USER: MILA: that's why I said"to me". I also thought he should have been nominated for donnie brasco, ie a role where he gives a thoughtful, well rounded performance as opposed to a caricature.

USER: MILA: i wanted john hurt to be alfred, but now that that's not the case i'd love for him to be the wizard.
USER: MILA: as much as I am excited myself, his role reeeeeeally looks and sounds like it was written for christoph waltz who I would haved loved to see go for in taratino films.
USER: MILA: i still think garfield is the better peter parker. tobey maguire played more a caricature of a nerd whereas garfield's character was much more realistic.

USER: MILA: i consider harry potter more of a halloween movie than a christmas one. if any of them were i'd think it'd be prisoner of azkaban. but, whatever floats your boat.
USER: MILA: i completely agree. they completely wasted his talent with the amount of screen time they gave him.

USER: MILA: i know they were all like twelve years old at the time but the acting in hp1 is pretty abominable
USER: MILA: i have to stop watching that move. something about the ending just leaves me a little hollow, and every time I watch it it gets worse. I love so many things about it, but I just can't do the ending anymore.
USER: MILA: i definitely disagree with this they cut out major portions of the book, they did a horrible job at casting some of the parts and the acting was extremely poor in many of the movies.

USER: MILA: i misread that as"til that terry gilliam was j. k. rowling's first choice to play harry potter"for a second and was very confused.
USER: MILA: i definitely disagree with this they cut out major portions of the book, they did a horrible job at casting some of the parts and the acting was extremely poor in many of the movies.
USER: MILA: hes not so bad in harry potter either though.

USER: MILA: heh, i've only seen the first, so i'm not sure if you're joking or not.
USER: MILA: have you seen lock stock and two smoking barrels?
USER: MILA: that's why I said"to me". I also thought he should have been nominated for donnie brasco, ie a role where he gives a thoughtful, well rounded performance as opposed to a caricature.
USER: MILA: have you seen the second one? actually I far preferred it to the first one. it's not great, but not nearly as bad as it sounds.
USER: MILA: but he's very good at it.
MILA: ive actually seen that one, just long ago so I cant say I remember him in it p probably before I kew who he was.
USER: MILA: &gt &gt kevin spacey was really the only actor in that film to actually have a career afterwords. &gt john cho. &gt kal penn? okay I don't get it.
