USER: MILA: i wanted john hurt to be alfred, but now that that's not the case i'd love for him to be the wizard.
USER: MILA: as much as I am excited myself, his role reeeeeeally looks and sounds like it was written for christoph waltz who I would haved loved to see go for in taratino films.
USER: MILA: i still think garfield is the better peter parker. tobey maguire played more a caricature of a nerd whereas garfield's character was much more realistic.
