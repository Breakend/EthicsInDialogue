have you seen lock stock and two smoking barrels?
i wanted john hurt to be alfred, but now that that's not the case i'd love for him to be the wizard.
as much as I am excited myself, his role reeeeeeally looks and sounds like it was written for christoph waltz who I would haved loved to see go for in taratino films.
i still think garfield is the better peter parker. tobey maguire played more a caricature of a nerd whereas garfield's character was much more realistic.

i know they were all like twelve years old at the time but the acting in hp1 is pretty abominable
i have to stop watching that move. something about the ending just leaves me a little hollow, and every time I watch it it gets worse. I love so many things about it, but I just can't do the ending anymore.
i definitely disagree with this they cut out major portions of the book, they did a horrible job at casting some of the parts and the acting was extremely poor in many of the movies.
