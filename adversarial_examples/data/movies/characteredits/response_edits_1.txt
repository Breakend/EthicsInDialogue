i agree! i'm sure the commentary on the sequel will be fantastic too. it's got the whole cast on it.

the movie has not been released yet. so it's obviously not a new revised cut of the actual film. it's a parody trailer also known something

as I just posted earlier, my favorite thing about this movie is the fact that I still can't decide to label it a slasher thriller or a comedy.
i didn't mind so much. it was almost a sort of modern take on"its a wonderful life"which is a genuine gem. not saying it's as good but I enjoy that sort of plot once in a while.

saw the movie but can't remember exactly what you're referring to. anyone care to enlighten me?

i've never seen deathtrap, i'll have to check it out.
i'm pretty sure that the people going to see that movie knew it was a horror film. not to mention the shining was rated r in the us. I mean you can't expect people to think it was going to be a family-friendly fantasy film.
jim carrey seems to do that in most of his films

neat. i'd have to watch them both again. I don't think my wife has seen any of these hitchcock flicks so i'll have to introduce them to her. will also put north by northwest on there as well.

there is a lot of action, but the"real action"as in episode is in the second half. in terms of light saber action, I would say there is slightly less than there is in ep3, but overall action is about the same.
i have to agree. have it on dvd, its one of the ones that rewards repeat viewing. the only thing that I hate about it is angelina jolie's awful fake accent. just makes me cringe.

what do you mean by"very intelligent"? I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but wouldn't describe it as very intelligent.

i loved it when I first saw it, but every time when I try to watch it for nostalgic reason, it's seems so cringeworthy cliched and saccharine.

thing about*avatar*is if you've seen*dances with wolves*and*fern gully*, you've seen*avatar*. I enjoyed it, but I was disappointed because everyone was saying how great it was, and while visually it was good, I thought james cameron just ripped off the plot from other movies.

there are d-releases on blu ray if that's what you're wondering. i'm sure they can be purchased as digital downloads as well.

that's a good way of putting it. it was pretty ridiculous at times but it felt appropriate for the movie and did not take away from it at all. I loved the movie.

i also expected kingsman to just be some chavs with guns but I went to see it and it's** much** better than I expected. I walked out of that theater with the biggest grin on my face. and % on rotten tomatoes for a movie like this says a lot.
