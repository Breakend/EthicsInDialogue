shawshank redemption is most likely the greatest film ever made.
i couldn't find much about it. all I know is that it needs to happen as much as possible. patton's film knowledge always astounds me.

dallas would be a great choice, I really love how they've built their team in the last couple years.
i think one of the better action movies i've ever watch was ronin. the one starring robert de niro. not that terrible keanu reeves samurai movie.

i honestly think people hate the prequels too much, yes episode I was pretty lame but the other two I thought were pretty good, obviously not as good as the originals but I still loved them and thought they were crucial parts of the series.

he basically said"i have nothing to say about this story, but nasri's girlfriend is hot."that is the very definition of mindless objectification and reducing women to their looks. her looks have nothing to do with this story and it's literally the only thing that u bubbbu mentioned.
