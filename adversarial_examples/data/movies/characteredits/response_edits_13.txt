yep. it's probably my single biggest hypocrisy. i'm generally a constitutionalist, and I think single payer at the federal level would be unconstitutional. but I don't see any other realistic way out of this mess.
not in the same way. it's a noir detective film, with a couple of intense sequences. I wouldn't put it up there with prisoners or seven, for example. blade runner is my favorite film, I even have a tattoo of rachael. just saying I wouldn't consider it an intense film.

they are all good, but whichever you opt to go for treat yourself to the book first if you haven't already, and watch all the other versions too. i've watched it about times so far and haven't been bored with it yet.

not in the same way. it's a noir detective film, with a couple of intense sequences. I wouldn't put it up there with prisoners or seven, for example. blade runner is my favorite film, I even have a tattoo of rachael. just saying I wouldn't consider it an intense film.

it's been a while since i've seen it and I never saw it in theaters. I remember thinking it's pretty good. I liked ryan reynolds and jessica biel a lot more than I liked wesley snipes in that movie. which wasn't the point of the film.

they are all good, but whichever you opt to go for treat yourself to the book first if you haven't already, and watch all the other versions too. i've watched it about times so far and haven't been bored with it yet.

blade runner is a great movie. I own a copy and if I had to pick it would be a close second. I just feel a scanner darkly is a closer and better adaptation of the original source material.
