this movie has been out for + years. i'm sure there's a statute if limitations on that.

how do you not use cg on a movie called"star wars"? is it possible to make it without cg, and not make it look like an-s movie. I guess they can focus more on the characters, and less space but.

how do you not use cg on a movie called"star wars"? is it possible to make it without cg, and not make it look like an-s movie. I guess they can focus more on the characters, and less space but.

shhh you're not allowed to say that! the mods will ban you for pointing out the obvious. and as for the people whose intentions are clear, they're given free reign to be as inflammatory as they want. but don't you call them the t-word.
