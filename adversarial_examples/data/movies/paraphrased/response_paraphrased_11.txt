i do not. and I don't understand how people enjoyed it. it's not even recognizable as a film.
wait what? are you saying a movie is good because it is based on something where the original subject matter was good? or am I missing your point?
i don't like being scared, but if there is a horror type film that is an absolute must see, I will at least give it a chance.
that's actually one of my favorite films! i'm sad I didn't think of that one to use!
i love movies and I actually liked the first iron man, second one wasn't bad either.
me too. that scene was hilarious. I think I hurt myself laughing at that.
