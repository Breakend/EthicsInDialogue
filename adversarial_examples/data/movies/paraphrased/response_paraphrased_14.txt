2001 didn't need a sequel, but it got one.
it has almost no action in it. it's a noir detective film.
yes you should. I didn't like it the first time. but now I love it.
wesley snipes. he has aged very well and he could still do it.
he didn't appear in x-men first class or days of future past.
they are all good, but whichever you opt to go for treat yourself to the book first if you haven't already, and watch all the other versions too. i've watched it about times so far and haven't been bored with it yet.
