i love both of those movies and see the humor in them. the one in the original post however doesn't seem that funny.
with chris pratt, peter serofinawicz and jon c. reilly, I was expecting something quite comic and don't think it lived up to that expectation.
i thought it would be funny, went to see it in theaters actually. just didn't do anything for me. I also hated nacho libre
always reminded me of this youtu. be
thank you. I thought I was the only one who felt this way. it had the structure of a good movie, but the end result was one or two jokes done over and over and over again. I shut it off about of the way through.
i take it you haven't seen this is the end. not a huge part of the movie, but its hilarious.
