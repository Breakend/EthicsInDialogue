i think leonardo dicaprio is overrated. don't get me wrong, he's a fine actor, but people act like it's gary oldman levels of injustice that he's never gotten an oscar.
samuel l. jackson. or michael fassbender.
i wish it was joshua jackson.
you didn't get it. if it was such a great performance, it would have made the movie better. keaton was far and away a better performance
kind of the way morgan freeman, michael caine, christopher walken, liam neeson, benedict cumberbatch, james earl jones, patrick stewart, and sean connery have different voices for every role?
