i'm gonna go out on a limb and say it is probably not his first time.
i haven't seen it yet
what about airplane? I don't understand why parodies are always terrible now. airplane has a on rt. scary movie was kind of funny but it was a horrible movie.
i didn't get a chance to watch it yet, I actually forgot it already came out. I heard it wasn't as good as the first, though.
the first film surprised me. I had pretty low expectations when I saw it, but I thought it was hilarious and ended up loving it.
show the original trilogy and leave it at that. I liked it when that's all I knew. I wish I could go back to the days when I didn't know about the most recent ones.
