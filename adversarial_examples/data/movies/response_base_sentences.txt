ive actually seen that one, just long ago so I cant say I remember him in it p probably before I kew who he was.
give it a year or two and it probably will be. i'd watch it.
on the wiki en. wikipedia.org how did they escape? that's what i'm wondering.
i knew someone would say this. not like anyone's ever gotten inspiration from a fictional character before, right? silly me.
every time I see a movie with matt damon in it now I find myself wondering when he's going to just randomly start going jason bourne on everyone.
while I hate him as a human, that's a pretty spot on. he was horrible in the other guys, but for some reason I like him in it.
star wars was the name of the abm project from the'80's for the us strategic command I believe. they're just making a reference to it.
vincent vega and jules winnfield.
i didn't get a chance to watch it yet, I actually forgot it already came out. I heard it wasn't as good as the first, though.
there is none. society will collapse at some point. even if it's hundreds of years from now. every empire falls at some point. it's just a question about how far and how hard.
&gt don't try telling paspatis, "it's just a movie!"to excuse its fictions. &gt"i don't think, "he says, "the movie should be more important than the truth."true, but just because movies always do this doesn't justify the truth not being sought or heard.
don't tell me what to do with my hands.
i think he just needs to finish the trilogy, seeing as there are only.
yes you should. I didn't like it the first time. but now I love it.
it's been mentioned multiple times in this thread, so I have to disagree with you.
and meryl streep could play tom hanks. and then go on to win an oscar for it.
t really? I mean, not to disparage your tastes, but surely the first one was the best movie?
he's the hero we deserve, but not the one we need. did I get that right?
that is certainly true. I guess when I listen to and judge a soundtrack, I think of it holistically. how it works in its entirety, not if it is original or not.
i can't tell if you're mocking the movie or genuinely never heard of it. i'll be positive and assume the latter. yes its a movie released recently in my territory and one which I thoroughly enjoyed. didn't think i'd ever describe a michael bay movie as subversive.
