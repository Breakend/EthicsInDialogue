obamacare dealt more with the insurance side, forcing them to spend a certain percentage on actual insurance coverage and also to force companies to provide coverage despite pre-existing conditions. but it did very little to address the ridiculous costs of health care itself.

americans like the affordable care act more than obamacare, so they'll probably sign up for and praise kynect without even realizing what it came from. like that one guy said on huffpo, "i hope this beats obamacare."lol

americans like the affordable care act more than obamacare, so they'll probably sign up for and praise kynect without even realizing what it came from. like that one guy said on huffpo, "i hope this beats obamacare."lol
