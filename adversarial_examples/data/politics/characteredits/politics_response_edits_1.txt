you know what they say, "if you can't remember being conquered and having everything you were ripped from your hands, you have no choice but to accept your new life as the only reality."i don't think they say that, but it would make a good conqueror's mission statement.
correct me if i'm wrong, but hadn't the us made a deal with ukraine to protect them from invasion since they gave up their nukes?
it didn't help that we had troops in saudi arabia. which was one of the causes of. not making a solid case, i'm only suggesting war invading another country isn't the solution. clearly it hasn't work, and I don't think it'll continue to work.

no. it was not a just war! it was a poor decision to invade iraq, that much is clear now. I think the only reasonable argument would be to determine whether or not people of could have reasonably believed it would be a just war.

there won't be war for the same reason there was no war with saudi arabia after. not because the us are chicken but because the us has very few allies in the region and can't really afford to declare war on the ones they have.
