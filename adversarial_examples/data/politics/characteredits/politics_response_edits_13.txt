next midterm elections are in years, which is why I was wondering why he said. he may have just put that down in error or he is from the future.
probably never. it has to get vote in the senate to move on, and it most undoubtedly won't.
because they know if this ever got to the supreme court they'd lose and it would harm their ability to gerrymander in the future.
no kiddin'. I was wondering where this guy was the last five years.
how do you know that? are you saying that congress doesn't have votes in the senate?

people said the same thing when obama ran for re-election and we know how that turned out. if hillary clinton is the democractic nominee, you can bet it won't be that simple for the republicans.
but, he is the head of the party. similar to the way that boehner and mcconnell are the heads of their party, at the moment.

i honestly found him to be insincere. a little too slick and was worried about his inexperience. I dunno, the best way I can explain it is that he was a likable guy for sure, but in the same way gwb was.
i'm starting to think his agenda will never work in the first place. i'm leaning more and more libertarian everyday and it's starting to make sense.
