training in way polls, but he is doing better than all candidates in way polls. meaning most of the democrat voters are willing to go to the independent candidate, but not as many of the independent candidate supporters are willing to go to the democrat.
bernie is going to do it though! he's going to make a political revolution because he is bringing a message of hope and change, something no other candidate has ever done before.

ben carson is also a great neurosurgeon. but that doesn't mean everything he says is right when he's not talking about anatomy.

he's literally the only candidate that I believe would try to stop the government's mass surveillance of americans. it's a shame that I disagree with a lot of his other points though.
