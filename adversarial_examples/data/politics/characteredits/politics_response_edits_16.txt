he could have won that election with no campaign slogan. basically just put himself up as'not bush' and he had that in the bag. but no, that would be too simple. he listened to his terrible handlers and the entire campaign was a circus of poor decisions.

oh I agree. the sandersbots are still convinced he's on a winning trajectory. don't know what it will take for them to see this.
never. he doesn't have hundreds of millions of dollars to spend on his campaign. this is america, yo.
and if you want to get really pedantic, fdr served more than terms, meaning it's** never** happened.
not sure what your argument is. are you saying that because only democrats and republicans have won a presidential election in the last years, that means I must only be one or the other?
where are the polls that show that? all of the current polls I see don't even mention him.
never. he doesn't have hundreds of millions of dollars to spend on his campaign. this is america, yo.
i really hope he takes the nom, because he does not have a chance of winning. there's not a poll in the world that has him in a position to beat clinton or warren.

and I suspect I won't live to see it happen again. I need to move.
i will vote for sanders in the primaries, but if he doesn't get the democratic nomination, I will vote for jill stein in the general election. hillary clinton absolutely will not get my vote.

well I mean if the man is practical and doesn't want to throw the vote away just to make a statement of support for someone who won't win, he has very good reason not to vote for him.
I would really like to talk about politics or news.

hindsight is. be honest, even if he was acting moderate at the time most of us that voted for obama still would have. at the time, in, it was inevitable. no matter how mccain acted.

john mccain is the reason mccain lost. he selected palin instead of lieberman he embraced the religious right he once despised and became a sold out bought and paid for shell of his former self. 2000 john mccain would be ashamed of john mccain

if you were paying attention at all during the primary, you would know how ridiculous that statement is, and everyone then knew that whoever came out of the dem primaries was going to win.

he could have won that election with no campaign slogan. basically just put himself up as'not bush' and he had that in the bag. but no, that would be too simple. he listened to his terrible handlers and the entire campaign was a circus of poor decisions.
