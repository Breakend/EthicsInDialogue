why do I get the feeling you know absolutely nothing about fracking or the oil industry in general? oh that's right, because you don't. let me guess, you believe fracking causes gas in people's water supply, right?

i think the point is that just and unjust are arbitrary. if I think the only justice is for all people to be free from all government control and I don't, then it's quite easy to say that all laws are unjust.
maybe not, but doesn't mean you don't stop trying. besides, if you can make it profitable to slow it down or even reverse it, you can bet someone will find a way to do just that.

one stone at a time. we weren't sure how to hold police accountable, but now slowly we are figuring out a way. this isn't about having all the answers, it's about finding them. no one has the world figured out, it's not a simple equation with a single solution.

the difference is that if you file a lawsuit it takes place in a court, where you don't pick the judges, the case can be dismissed, decisions will be based on precedent and if you lose, you will be held liable for your opponents legal fees

" you can't take a nd timeout in a row"and gives them all the benefits of a nd timeout including no penalty call for men on the field. that's gotta be one of the worst errors i've seen.

fracking is the source of a huge amount of the waste water being injected, yes. it doesn't have to be, but it's the cheapest option so, surprise surprise, they do it.
why do you think that would work? we regulate nearly everything in the us and nothing changes, and nothing will if your regulations are so nonsensical, the only people that can follow them are the ones with enough money to not get in trouble.
