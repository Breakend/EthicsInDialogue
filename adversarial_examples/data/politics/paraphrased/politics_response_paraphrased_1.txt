in years you'll be hearing"well, the aca is basically just a tweaked version of romneycare, so that's why it's something
because it forces people to buy something they may not want. it is unethical and immoral.
. why would I be crying? you know you're only proving my point, right?
don't forget the public option didn't make it in. that would have made it a real step in the right direction. I hope it is anyway, but i'm not certain.
states can opt out of it, and it still doesn't replace all private insurance.
at first I thought, well, take it and wear it as a badge of honor. but the more I learn about it, the more I realize it's not any kind of"care", it's just a set of rules and regulations.
