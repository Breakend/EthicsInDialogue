if you're talking about the great depression in the s, even that wasn't a collapse.
bad try again. what I said was true. hyperinflation was not an issue after. the dawes plan in was put in place so germany could easily repay its war debt, which is dutifully did right up until the great depression.
not sure how that is relevant. is this one of those"top %'ers need to pay more"?
it wasn't even the major thing. in fact, w was a massive regulator and called on congress to fix the problem before the financial crisis even got started, but he was ignored by barney and co. they thought everything was fine.
if people start revolting they will just call their militarized police to come handle things. that's why voting is important. it's the safest way to change the system.
I would really like to talk about politics or news.
