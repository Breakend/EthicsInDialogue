you must be reading a different article. if it angers you when the president does it, why doesnt it bother you when republicans do it, after crying about the president doing it for years?
for the second half of is presidency, yes, but you need to do it for a while to make a difference. and the cuts loopholes have been in place for a while. there's a lot more of them that need to be removed raised.
I would really like to talk about politics or news.
obama did not run as a'wall street whore' and even though it turned out that he is, he's still not as bad as mccain or romney.
if the president doesn't sign a bill that was passed by congress it still goes into law. he'd have to veto the bill to stop this.
i am not a hillary supporter, but I can't figure out why you thought this was the appropriate place to post your comment.
