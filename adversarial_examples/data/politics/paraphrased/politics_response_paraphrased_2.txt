if the troops are there when they're not authorized to be there by a country's govt, what do you call it?
what do you mean"what happened"? if you have a claim, make it, and i'll tell you if it's supported by actual facts or not. the us"creating"al-qaeda or isis, for example, is not.
it didn't help that we had troops in saudi arabia. which was one of the causes of. not making a solid case, i'm only suggesting war invading another country isn't the solution. clearly it hasn't work, and I don't think it'll continue to work.
