i been saying this for a while now. I know when it hits. things are going to get crazy.
i've got an idea-if you can't afford something, then don't buy it.
I would really like to talk about politics or news.
the projectors are like $30- grand a piece, then once you include all the other equipment and installation and i'm guessing a few hundred thousand?
the problem's that there's not enough space to build in sf, and not enough housing for the people already here. techcrunch had a good article on that, but I can't find it now.
the houses are often paid for in cash. so if there is a bubble, it won't be as severe.
