i live in canada, and most of the people I know do. but we're not you guys.
it didn't help that we had troops in saudi arabia. which was one of the causes of. not making a solid case, i'm only suggesting war invading another country isn't the solution. clearly it hasn't work, and I don't think it'll continue to work.

really? I thought he campaigned against the aca in.
sure, and it hurt a lot of people who are locked into their homes because of it. they can afford the mortgage, but if they sell they lose a large amount of their original investment. so what's your point?
I would really like to talk about politics or news.
