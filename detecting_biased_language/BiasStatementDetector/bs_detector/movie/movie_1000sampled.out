| to find something          |        |              |        |                |
| worthwhile in someone's    |        |              |        |                |
| death. it's no trade-off.  |        |              |        |                |

| his death. it couldn't be. |        |              |        |                |
| but maybe there is some    |        |              |        |                |
| value in it. i know it's   |        |              |        |                |
| the first thing i've ever  |        |              |        |                |
| seen that's really gotten  |        |              |        |                |
| to you. now the question   |        |              |        |                |
| is what will you do with   |        |              |        |                |
| it. if it gets you out of  |        |              |        |                |
| flight status...so you     |        |              |        |                |

| accident waiting to        |        |              |        |                |
| happen. you think i        |        |              |        |                |
| shouldn't fly. i didn't    |        |              |        |                |
| say that. that's up to     |        |              |        |                |
| you. i think that if you   |        |              |        |                |
| do if you choose to come   |        |              |        |                |

| you have any brothers and  |        |              |        |                |

| old enough to play with.   |        |              |        |                |
| why not? it died? yeah.    |        |              |        |                |
| why? hit was borned a      |        |              |        |                |
| little too early on. my    |        |              |        |                |
| mother and father made hit |        |              |        |                |
| come too early some way or |        |              |        |                |
| other. i reckon they       |        |              |        |                |
| changed their mind about   |        |              |        |                |
| havin' another'n. i was    |        |              |        |                |

| care too much for me so i  |        |              |        |                |
| reckon they didn't need    |        |              |        |                |
| somethin' else to worry    |        |              |        |                |

| barrel there and opened up |        |              |        |                |
| the towel to see 'cause    |        |              |        |                |

| somethin' movin' in it.    |        |              |        |                |
| hit was bloody-like around |        |              |        |                |
| that towel. hit was a      |        |              |        |                |
| little ol' bitty baby no   |        |              |        |                |
| bigger than a squirrel. it |        |              |        |                |
| was alive? yes sir. right  |        |              |        |                |
| then it was. a boy or      |        |              |        |                |
| girl? a little ol' boy.    |        |              |        |                |
| you threw it in a trash    |        |              |        |                |
| barrel? i didn't feel      |        |              |        |                |
| right about doin' that. i  |        |              |        |                |
| takened a shoe box from    |        |              |        |                |
| there in the shed and      |        |              |        |                |
| emptied out some           |        |              |        |                |
| screwdrivers and nuts and  |        |              |        |                |
| warshers from it and put   |        |              |        |                |
| the little feller in that  |        |              |        |                |
| and buried him in the      |        |              |        |                |
| corner of the yard there.  |        |              |        |                |
| that seemed more proper to |        |              |        |                |
| me i reckon. it was still  |        |              |        |                |
| alive when you buried it?  |        |              |        |                |
| i heared it cryin' a       |        |              |        |                |
| little through that box.   |        |              |        |                |
| that don't seem right. it  |        |              |        |                |
| seems like you should have |        |              |        |                |
| kept him alive and took    |        |              |        |                |
| care of him if he was your |        |              |        |                |
| brother. i wadn't but six  |        |              |        |                |
| or eight. i reckon i       |        |              |        |                |
| didn't know what to do. i  |        |              |        |                |
| didn't know how to care    |        |              |        |                |
| for no baby. mama and      |        |              |        |                |

| spent in atlantic city -   |        |              |        |                |
| sonny was frantic - he     |        |              |        |                |
| knew i was drinking he     |        |              |        |                |
| didn't know where i was    |        |              |        |                |
| ... who i was with.  i     |        |              |        |                |
| couldn't explain why i did |        |              |        |                |
| the things i did. so i     |        |              |        |                |
| went to this psychiatrist  |        |              |        |                |
| who explained to me i was  |        |              |        |                |
| a woman in a man's body.   |        |              |        |                |
| so sonny right away wanted |        |              |        |                |
| to get me money for a sex  |        |              |        |                |
| change operation: but      |        |              |        |                |
| where was he to get that?  |        |              |        |                |
| 2500 dollars!  my god he's |        |              |        |                |

| already. he needed money?  |        |              |        |                |
| for the operation for you? |        |              |        |                |
| it made him crazy - so     |        |              |        |                |
| much demand he'd fly into  |        |              |        |                |
| this rages.  and i got     |        |              |        |                |
| more depressed than ever i |        |              |        |                |
| saw i'd never get the      |        |              |        |                |
| operation.  so i tried to  |        |              |        |                |
| take my life - i swallowed |        |              |        |                |
