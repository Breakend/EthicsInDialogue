| the chosen ones "" ? no .  |        |              |        |                |
| i definitely don 't think  |        |              |        |                |
| anyone is a chosen one of  |        |              |        |                |
| any type from any being or |        |              |        |                |
| entity . if you dont think |        |              |        |                |
| that do see it norma for   |        |              |        |                |
| them to think that cased   |        |              |        |                |
| on a book that they don 't |        |              |        |                |
| believe in anyway ? any    |        |              |        |                |
| logic in it ? i don 't     |        |              |        |                |
| think all israeli 's       |        |              |        |                |
| believe that  and most     |        |              |        |                |
| certainly i know that all  |        |              |        |                |
| jews do not think that .   |        |              |        |                |

| settlements for this       |        |              |        |                |
| reason ? that they ar      |        |              |        |                |
| protecting their land      |        |              |        |                |
| given from god don 't many |        |              |        |                |
| who are fighting against   |        |              |        |                |
| israel claim they are      |        |              |        |                |
| doing it in the name of    |        |              |        |                |

| so . looking at the cruise | 0.187  | 0.433        | 0.440  | 6              |
| itinerary  in the event    |        |              |        |                |
| that it turns into a half  |        |              |        |                |
| charter  i think we 're    |        |              |        |                |
| still in front row . at    |        |              |        |                |

| possible that it 'll       |        |              |        |                |

| twitter app like tweetdeck |        |              |        |                |
