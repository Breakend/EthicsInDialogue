| etc  lines going across    |        |              |        |                |
| the screen and nothing is  |        |              |        |                |
| readable like when you set |        |              |        |                |
| a resolution the monitor   |        |              |        |                |
| cant handle um rite if its |        |              |        |                |

| to add the resolution to   |        |              |        |                |

| make sure it is at the end |        |              |        |                |
| how do i do that ? oh      |        |              |        |                |
| don't know much about it   |        |              |        |                |
| i just found this script   |        |              |        |                |
| on the net and i added it  |        |              |        |                |
| put it in /etc/rc . local  |        |              |        |                |
| or /etc/crontab with a     |        |              |        |                |
| line like : @reboot user   |        |              |        |                |
| command so i should copy   |        |              |        |                |
| the script to /etc/rc .    |        |              |        |                |
| local and try reboot to    |        |              |        |                |
| see if that works ? don't  |        |              |        |                |

| the desktop  no problem .  |        |              |        |                |
| but if i hit ctrl-alt-f1   |        |              |        |                |
| to go to a console  then   |        |              |        |                |
| ctrl-alt-f7 to go back to  |        |              |        |                |
| the desktop  i just get a  |        |              |        |                |
| beige that flashes to      |        |              |        |                |
| white and back to beige    |        |              |        |                |
| constantly . anyone know   |        |              |        |                |
| what this is ? sounds like |        |              |        |                |
| x has a problem probably a |        |              |        |                |
| driver bug probably just a |        |              |        |                |
| bug in the driver maybe    |        |              |        |                |
| but it looks kind of       |        |              |        |                |
| intentional -- the colour  |        |              |        |                |
| fades from beige to white  |        |              |        |                |
| and back again . it 's the |        |              |        |                |

| intel_agp isn't a driver   |        |              |        |                |
| ok  what i'm trying to say |        |              |        |                |
| is it 's a standard i810   |        |              |        |                |
| or whatever integrated     |        |              |        |                |

| standard drivers for that  |        |              |        |                |
| . it seems someone would   |        |              |        |                |
| have noticed such a large  |        |              |        |                |
| bug in the driver for such |        |              |        |                |
| a popular chipset that     |        |              |        |                |
| driver is filled with bugs |        |              |        |                |
| - and the fact that you    |        |              |        |                |
| don't even know what       |        |              |        |                |
| driver your using suggest  |        |              |        |                |
| you may have made ocnfig   |        |              |        |                |
| errors yourself no  i am   |        |              |        |                |

| service u try to connect   |        |              |        |                |
| to i am trying to find out |        |              |        |                |
| because when i type in the |        |              |        |                |
| web address of my web page |        |              |        |                |

| page then it uses 127.0 .  |        |              |        |                |
| 0.1 ) cause localhost is   |        |              |        |                |
| 127.0 . 0.1 your saying my |        |              |        |                |
| router uses 127.0 . 0.1 ?  |        |              |        |                |
| if you say :               |        |              |        |                |
| http://localhost/ gives    |        |              |        |                |
| your routers homepage      |        |              |        |                |
| then it uses localhost and |        |              |        |                |
| localhost is always 127.0  |        |              |        |                |
| . 0.1 and the server is on |        |              |        |                |
| port 80 so your saying     |        |              |        |                |
| both my router and my      |        |              |        |                |
| apache server are both     |        |              |        |                |
| using port 80 ? only your  |        |              |        |                |
| apache .. your router is   |        |              |        |                |
| at least your webserver i  |        |              |        |                |
| don't really know ... can  |        |              |        |                |
| be many things .. 80 then  |        |              |        |                |
| that 's why i get my       |        |              |        |                |
| router 's homepage wehn i  |        |              |        |                |
| try to access my web page  |        |              |        |                |

| ? thanks thanks bedford    |        |              |        |                |
| thanks guys i just did ""  |        |              |        |                |
| sudo apt-get update "" and |        |              |        |                |
| then "" sudo apt-get       |        |              |        |                |
| upgrade "" and apt manager |        |              |        |                |
| before was saying there    |        |              |        |                |
| was 40+ updates now it     |        |              |        |                |
| says there is 7 still left |        |              |        |                |
| wtf ? will i always have   |        |              |        |                |
| to use that apt manager    |        |              |        |                |
| notifier in the corner ?   |        |              |        |                |
| maybe those updates        |        |              |        |                |
| require a dist-upgrade ok  |        |              |        |                |
| so how would i do them     |        |              |        |                |
| using apt-get command ?    |        |              |        |                |
| sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  |        |              |        |                |
| thanks i think its working |        |              |        |                |
| :) :) would it be correct  |        |              |        |                |
| to write :"" apt-get       |        |              |        |                |
| update && apt-get upgrade  |        |              |        |                |
| && apt-get dist-upgrade "" |        |              |        |                |
| ? apt-get update && apt-   |        |              |        |                |
| get dist-upgrade would be  |        |              |        |                |
| enough so i should always  |        |              |        |                |
| use dist-upgrade and it    |        |              |        |                |
| will preclude all upgrade  |        |              |        |                |
| command would get me       |        |              |        |                |
| correct ? in most cases    |        |              |        |                |
| youll only need a normal   |        |              |        |                |
| upgrade thanks i think     |        |              |        |                |
| only the kernel-updates    |        |              |        |                |
| and other stuff need a     |        |              |        |                |
| dist-upgrade your 7        |        |              |        |                |
| packages are linux-* arent |        |              |        |                |
| they ? so why not do it    |        |              |        |                |
| all the time just to be    |        |              |        |                |
| safe if it precludes all   |        |              |        |                |
| the stuff anyway yes you   |        |              |        |                |
| can do it all the time     |        |              |        |                |
| but its always better to   |        |              |        |                |
| know when youre installing |        |              |        |                |
| very basic updates like a  |        |              |        |                |
| new kernel how do you      |        |              |        |                |
| usually do upgrades ?      |        |              |        |                |
| gotcha i use the icon in   |        |              |        |                |

| you the ipadress i'm       |        |              |        |                |
| afraid i don't recommend   |        |              |        |                |
| having mysql listen on a   |        |              |        |                |
| public ip address  but i   |        |              |        |                |
| can tell you how to let it |        |              |        |                |
| through your firewall if   |        |              |        |                |
| you insist on doing that   |        |              |        |                |
| also if you connect via    |        |              |        |                |
| the public ip it probably  |        |              |        |                |
| won't count as a local     |        |              |        |                |
| connection well  i don't   |        |              |        |                |
| intend to keep it that way |        |              |        |                |
| - i want to do it          |        |              |        |                |
| temporarily to set up some |        |              |        |                |
| databases . then i intend  |        |              |        |                |
| to secure it again . so    |        |              |        |                |
| please tell me how .       |        |              |        |                |
| knowledge never hurt any   |        |              |        |                |
| one ... or did it ? i      |        |              |        |                |
| dunno why you don't just   |        |              |        |                |
| have it listen locally and |        |              |        |                |
| do your stuff locally  but |        |              |        |                |
| if you insist - iptables   |        |              |        |                |
| -a input -p tcp -- dport   |        |              |        |                |
| 3306 -j accept if that     |        |              |        |                |
| doesn't do it  use -i      |        |              |        |                |
| instead of -a thanks  i    |        |              |        |                |
| could never get htose      |        |              |        |                |
| iptables figured out       |        |              |        |                |
| myself . the reason is ... |        |              |        |                |
| well  to be honest -       |        |              |        |                |
| although i'm ok with       |        |              |        |                |
| setting up databases in    |        |              |        |                |
| mysql through the console  |        |              |        |                |

| so i'd like to use mysql   |        |              |        |                |
| administrator to do it     |        |              |        |                |
| since it can take care of  |        |              |        |                |
| different versions and     |        |              |        |                |

| bit processor what happens |        |              |        |                |
| ? i have a amd sempron     |        |              |        |                |
| mobile and it says on one  |        |              |        |                |
| of the product sheets 64   |        |              |        |                |
| bit and 32 bit so i am     |        |              |        |                |
| confused and was wondering |        |              |        |                |
| if there is an advantage   |        |              |        |                |
| to the 64 bit one ? you'll |        |              |        |                |
| want the 32bit edititon    |        |              |        |                |
| anyway some important      |        |              |        |                |
| codecs and packages don't  |        |              |        |                |
| run on 64bit libs ....     |        |              |        |                |
| endless trouble for        |        |              |        |                |
| negligible performance     |        |              |        |                |
| gains in 64bit mode so     |        |              |        |                |
| what ? ndiswrapper isn't   |        |              |        |                |
| such a pita ... with       |        |              |        |                |
| ndiswrapper did it ? then  |        |              |        |                |
| try again if it works out  |        |              |        |                |
| of the box is ndiswrapper  |        |              |        |                |
| in synaptic ?              |        |              |        |                |

| reboot ? did you have      |        |              |        |                |
| another kernel you were    |        |              |        |                |
| switching into ? nope . i  |        |              |        |                |
| just restarted  as in  hit |        |              |        |                |
| the power button           |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** yes but why if |        |              |        |                |
| you weren't changing into  |        |              |        |                |
| another kernel ? rebooting |        |              |        |                |
| is always unnecessary      |        |              |        |                |
| unless you are on windows  |        |              |        |                |
| or need to switch kernels  |        |              |        |                |
| i would just try removing  |        |              |        |                |
| the totem configuration    |        |              |        |                |
| directory which i assume   |        |              |        |                |
| will be in ~/ . totem or   |        |              |        |                |
| ~/ . **unknown** i do not  |        |              |        |                |
| use totem so i can't be    |        |              |        |                |
| sure  but someone else     |        |              |        |                |
| might tell you i searched  |        |              |        |                |
| but i could find and       |        |              |        |                |
| config file .. i'll google |        |              |        |                |

| ? it seems like it adds a  |        |              |        |                |
| great deal of complexity   |        |              |        |                |

| installing ubuntu .. last  |        |              |        |                |
| time i install linux i had |        |              |        |                |
| to configure swap .. do    |        |              |        |                |
| you still have to do that  |        |              |        |                |
| with ubuntu during the     |        |              |        |                |
| install process ? what is  |        |              |        |                |
| the calculation i use to   |        |              |        |                |
| detrimine how big i make   |        |              |        |                |
| my swap compared to how    |        |              |        |                |
| much ram i have ? there    |        |              |        |                |
| isn't one . it depends on  |        |              |        |                |
| preferences and religions  |        |              |        |                |
| . but you should make your |        |              |        |                |
| swap *at least* as big as  |        |              |        |                |
| your ram  or things like   |        |              |        |                |

| here though no ... but     |        |              |        |                |
| perhaps you should         |        |              |        |                |
| consider using             |        |              |        |                |

| a lot of problems or why   |        |              |        |                |
| there is not a alternative |        |              |        |                |
| effekt as i said  the      |        |              |        |                |
| driver must provide glx_ex |        |              |        |                |
| t_texture_from_pixmap      |        |              |        |                |
| extension for compiz to    |        |              |        |                |
| work so there is not a     |        |              |        |                |
| lite version or lite       |        |              |        |                |
| settings for compiz ?      |        |              |        |                |
| there is simple-ccsm for   |        |              |        |                |
| light settings but that    |        |              |        |                |
| will do nothing without    |        |              |        |                |
| compiz actually running .  |        |              |        |                |
| there is no light compiz   |        |              |        |                |
| your driver needs          |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** sounds         |        |              |        |                |
| physical not software      |        |              |        |                |
| based yes  the driver      |        |              |        |                |
| doesnt support **unknown** |        |              |        |                |
| because the hardware       |        |              |        |                |
| cannot do it i had xp      |        |              |        |                |
| before ubuntu and i had    |        |              |        |                |
| some desktop effects here  |        |              |        |                |
| with 3d effects like the   |        |              |        |                |
| desktop box and stuff like |        |              |        |                |
| that  thats why its hard   |        |              |        |                |
| to belive that there is    |        |              |        |                |
| not another solution :(    |        |              |        |                |
| compiz does not run on     |        |              |        |                |
| windows . you must have a  |        |              |        |                |
| driver that supports       |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** and obviously  |        |              |        |                |
| a card that can do it in   |        |              |        |                |
| the first place whatever   |        |              |        |                |
| windows had was not compiz |        |              |        |                |
| and it didnt require this  |        |              |        |                |
| opengl specification well  |        |              |        |                |
| actually its a driver spec |        |              |        |                |
| but anyway its an opengl   |        |              |        |                |
| driver extension           |        |              |        |                |
| specification and sis just |        |              |        |                |
| cant do it there are 3d    |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** like blender   |        |              |        |                |
| on other opensource stuff  |        |              |        |                |
| i can use them and do      |        |              |        |                |
| fancy realtime things with |        |              |        |                |
| it that doesnt mean        |        |              |        |                |

| unetbootin works for me    |        |              |        |                |
| every time : as indicated  |        |              |        |                |
| earlier the iso image and  |        |              |        |                |
| the installed os are on    |        |              |        |                |
| the same drive would that  |        |              |        |                |
| impose some problem : i am |        |              |        |                |
| dual booted with xp i hv   |        |              |        |                |
| the iso img on the ntfs    |        |              |        |                |

| browser ok : however i     |        |              |        |                |
| cannot have that listed in |        |              |        |                |
| under places ? this could  |        |              |        |                |
| be the reason that this    |        |              |        |                |
| utility is unable to       |        |              |        |                |
| recognize the iso even     |        |              |        |                |
| after giving it the        |        |              |        |                |
| correct path why not move  |        |              |        |                |
| it to your ubuntu          |        |              |        |                |
| partition ?? then try      |        |              |        |                |
| unetbootin again           |        |              |        |                |

| hello  is there a way ( a  | 0.162  | 0.513        | 0.783  | 16.500         |
| simple one ) to blacklist  |        |              |        |                |
| a package to be upgraded ? |        |              |        |                |
| i tried unattended-        |        |              |        |                |
| upgrades  with no luck     |        |              |        |                |
| thanks in advance of       |        |              |        |                |
| course its called pinning  |        |              |        |                |
| uhm  ok .. so the          |        |              |        |                |
| blacklist on unattended-   |        |              |        |                |
| upgrades is not the        |        |              |        |                |
| correct way ehh i would    |        |              |        |                |
| assume blacklist means not |        |              |        |                |
| installable period ok  its |        |              |        |                |
| simple ( seems :p )  echo  |        |              |        |                |
| package hold | dpkg --     |        |              |        |                |
| set-selections actually    |        |              |        |                |
| there are two different    |        |              |        |                |
| things  there is the apt-  |        |              |        |                |
| get blacklist which doesnt |        |              |        |                |
| upgrade certain packages   |        |              |        |                |
| automatically  and there   |        |              |        |                |
| is pinning to make sure a  |        |              |        |                |
| package stays at a certain |        |              |        |                |
| revision no  i just want   |        |              |        |                |
| to mantain a specifically  |        |              |        |                |
| version of a package  so   |        |              |        |                |
| probably the ' hold ' is   |        |              |        |                |
| the correct way            |        |              |        |                |

| when i was using 8.10 my   |        |              |        |                |

| in jaunty . you aren't     |        |              |        |                |
| alone . jaunty just sucks  |        |              |        |                |
| . that 's basically it . i |        |              |        |                |

| switched to jaunty         |        |              |        |                |

| still happy with my 8.10   |        |              |        |                |

| =) bah  everything is      |        |              |        |                |
| debatable not really  i'm  |        |              |        |                |
| talking about a            |        |              |        |                |
| substantiated discussion   |        |              |        |                |
| from either side yeah      |        |              |        |                |
| well . there is            |        |              |        |                |
| substantiated debate about |        |              |        |                |
| a load of things .         |        |              |        |                |
| including which distro     |        |              |        |                |
| rocks hardest . :) there   |        |              |        |                |
| is . and ? : s just tell   |        |              |        |                |
| people what 's the way you |        |              |        |                |
| do it  or you believe it   |        |              |        |                |
| 's best  and if it 's      |        |              |        |                |
| muddy  tell em to form     |        |              |        |                |
| their own opinion . :)     |        |              |        |                |
| point is  sudo and su use  |        |              |        |                |
| the same security system   |        |              |        |                |
| so in general they're both |        |              |        |                |
| subject to the same flaws  |        |              |        |                |
| and strengths true  but    |        |              |        |                |
| ubuntu seems to like sudo  |        |              |        |                |
| so i'll just piont anyone  |        |              |        |                |
| to that wiki page .        |        |              |        |                |

| to install **unknown** and |        |              |        |                |

| that apache uses only      |        |              |        |                |
| problem is there is no www |        |              |        |                |
| directory there thanks     |        |              |        |                |
| mrak does anybody know     |        |              |        |                |
| about the www directory    |        |              |        |                |
| and how to make i appear   |        |              |        |                |
| in user groups ? dj i'm    |        |              |        |                |
| not sure what the means i  |        |              |        |                |
| have been told to add      |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** to the         |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** in user groups |        |              |        |                |
| i was trying to do it      |        |              |        |                |
| through the ubuntu gui you |        |              |        |                |
| want to add the user ""    |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** "" to the      |        |              |        |                |
| group named "" www ""?     |        |              |        |                |
| then you might want to use |        |              |        |                |
| "" gpasswd -a $user $group |        |              |        |                |
| "" so you don't have a     |        |              |        |                |
| group named "" www ""?     |        |              |        |                |
| what do you actually want  |        |              |        |                |
| to achieve ? - . - to just |        |              |        |                |
| add a group you could do   |        |              |        |                |
| "" groupadd $group "" but  |        |              |        |                |
| it 's most likely that     |        |              |        |                |
| this won't solve your      |        |              |        |                |
| issue i have no idea what  |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** is ... no no . |        |              |        |                |
| what 's the issue ? i mean |        |              |        |                |
| what is the problem now    |        |              |        |                |
| i'm following a set of     |        |              |        |                |
| instructions and the www   |        |              |        |                |

| displaying in the user     |        |              |        |                |
| groups so i cannot add     |        |              |        |                |
| myself to it or i'm not    |        |              |        |                |
| even sure whether or not   |        |              |        |                |
| its me or the program that |        |              |        |                |
| needs to be added i hope   |        |              |        |                |
| that didnt sound rude -i   |        |              |        |                |
| didnt mean it to :-)"      |        |              |        |                |

| beryl is a                 |        |              |        |                |

| instructions you need .    |        |              |        |                |
| filter out the rest of us  |        |              |        |                |

| a great deal of experience |        |              |        |                |
| with ubu  i would take     |        |              |        |                |
| their advice . at worst    |        |              |        |                |
| it will do until you find  |        |              |        |                |
| a better way . ok i see    |        |              |        |                |
| but i wonder if there is   |        |              |        |                |
| another way .              |        |              |        |                |

| i have im-sensors and the  | -0.342 | 0.500        | -0.858 | 2.900          |
| gnome applet working fine  |        |              |        |                |
| . but can i get those      |        |              |        |                |
| values outside gnome ?     |        |              |        |                |
| /proc/acpi ... temp        |        |              |        |                |
| doesn't report correct     |        |              |        |                |
| value what are you trying  |        |              |        |                |
| to do ? get temperature    |        |              |        |                |
| information ? yes without  |        |              |        |                |
| using the sensors applet   |        |              |        |                |
| outside gnome the ' acpi ' |        |              |        |                |
| command does that . add    |        |              |        |                |
| the -t option to make it   |        |              |        |                |
| print temperature info     |        |              |        |                |
| instead of just            |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** . if the       |        |              |        |                |
| values look wrong  that 's |        |              |        |                |
| because it uses celsius by |        |              |        |                |
| default . add ' -f ' to    |        |              |        |                |
| get farenheit . no acpi -t |        |              |        |                |
| reports the wrong one . it |        |              |        |                |
| 's constantly 40 . that    |        |              |        |                |
| sounds about right . 104   |        |              |        |                |
| degrees : it 's in celsius |        |              |        |                |
| until you add '            |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** so run ' acpi  |        |              |        |                |
| -tf ' instead . unless the |        |              |        |                |
| problem is that you know   |        |              |        |                |
| it should be much higher ? |        |              |        |                |
| because then you're having |        |              |        |                |
| a problem with acpi  and i |        |              |        |                |
| don't know what to do      |        |              |        |                |
| about that . no it 's not  |        |              |        |                |
| right . it always reports  |        |              |        |                |
| 40 . it never fluctuates . |        |              |        |                |
| after gaming or whatever   |        |              |        |                |
| always 40 . so i installed |        |              |        |                |
| lmsenors and now i have    |        |              |        |                |
| additional sensors that    |        |              |        |                |
| work with sensors applet . |        |              |        |                |
| i want to read those       |        |              |        |                |
| values                     |        |              |        |                |

| module . problem is  every |        |              |        |                |
| time grub2 is updated  it  |        |              |        |                |

| module . any way to update |        |              |        |                |

| how can i use the ntfs     | 0.034  | 0.537        | 0.815  | 6.400          |
| security ? ntfs is a       |        |              |        |                |
| filesystem - to use it in  |        |              |        |                |
| linux you need to install  |        |              |        |                |
| ntfs-3g - it gives the     |        |              |        |                |
| volume full access  but i  |        |              |        |                |
| need the security to work  |        |              |        |                |
| windows security .. you    |        |              |        |                |
| mean file permissions      |        |              |        |                |
| right ? in other words     |        |              |        |                |
| your users cannot access   |        |              |        |                |
| the data off the drive     |        |              |        |                |
| because everything is      |        |              |        |                |
| owned by root ?            |        |              |        |                |

| i want a text mode dapper  | -0.017 | 0.507        | 0.936  | 2.500          |

| isos all disappeared ? you |        |              |        |                |
| mean the ' alternate       |        |              |        |                |
| installation cd ' image ?  |        |              |        |                |
| i don't believe so  as it  |        |              |        |                |
| is the _desktop_ cd  made  |        |              |        |                |
| for **unknown** . :) well  |        |              |        |                |
| it 's just the same ...    |        |              |        |                |
| but the live can install   |        |              |        |                |
| too :) that 's true - and  |        |              |        |                |

| have a utility called udev |        |              |        |                |
| that manages them great    |        |              |        |                |

| hi everybody i want just   | 0.414  | 0.620        | 0.825  | 12.300         |
| to know if it 's possible  |        |              |        |                |
| to install ubuntu version  |        |              |        |                |
| 5.10 and update it to the  |        |              |        |                |
| last version ? it would be |        |              |        |                |
| cleaner to just install    |        |              |        |                |
| the latest should be       |        |              |        |                |
| though xubuntu would be    |        |              |        |                |
| what i'd recommend         |        |              |        |                |
| lighter than gnome for     |        |              |        |                |
| 256mb of ram if she uses   |        |              |        |                |
| xubuntu  can she use other |        |              |        |                |
| software such as           |        |              |        |                |
| openoffice  firefox        |        |              |        |                |
| update manager  music      |        |              |        |                |
| player ...? absolutely  it |        |              |        |                |
| uses xfce4 as the desktop  |        |              |        |                |
| quite a bit leaner and     |        |              |        |                |
| faster on an older machine |        |              |        |                |
| leaving more room for apps |        |              |        |                |
| to run it would even run   |        |              |        |                |
| gnome  but xubuntu would   |        |              |        |                |
| be faster running          |        |              |        |                |
| installing other debian    |        |              |        |                |
| software is also possible  |        |              |        |                |
| ?!! absolutely  the only   |        |              |        |                |
| difference is just the     |        |              |        |                |
| default look of the        |        |              |        |                |
| desktop xfce4 is quite     |        |              |        |                |
| easy to use too  just less |        |              |        |                |
| resource intensive than    |        |              |        |                |
| full on gnome              |        |              |        |                |

| does anyone know what      | -0.159 | 0.479        | -0.764 | 6.800          |
| causes sound to be choppy  |        |              |        |                |
| and broken in 11.10  never |        |              |        |                |
| had this happen in 10.04   |        |              |        |                |
| what kind of sound card ?  |        |              |        |                |
| : soundblaster xfi i see a |        |              |        |                |
| few people reporting this  |        |              |        |                |
| but not many some people   |        |              |        |                |
| report the same problem    |        |              |        |                |
| with windows 64bit drivers |        |              |        |                |
| : im running win 7 64      |        |              |        |                |
| right now with no problem  |        |              |        |                |
| if it happens in one os    |        |              |        |                |
| but not another  maybe it  |        |              |        |                |
| 's one of the other linux  |        |              |        |                |
| drivers causing            |        |              |        |                |
| interference with the xfi  |        |              |        |                |
| ? i ended up having to     |        |              |        |                |
| dump my creative labs card |        |              |        |                |
| because despite working    |        |              |        |                |
| well in windows  it caused |        |              |        |                |
| problems in linux ubuntu   |        |              |        |                |
| 11.04 works just fine but  |        |              |        |                |
| 11.10 is so choppy i can   |        |              |        |                |
| not here any sounds and    |        |              |        |                |
| mp3 is just crapola that   |        |              |        |                |
| makes it all the more      |        |              |        |                |
| likely that it 's a        |        |              |        |                |
| problem with one of the    |        |              |        |                |
| other drivers which is     |        |              |        |                |
| newer in 11.10 ok that     |        |              |        |                |
| makes sense  i wonder if   |        |              |        |                |
| it might get fixed or if   |        |              |        |                |
| there is a easy way to fix |        |              |        |                |
| it because if it were a    |        |              |        |                |
| newer xfi driver at fault  |        |              |        |                |
| then there would have been |        |              |        |                |
| a popular outcry by now    |        |              |        |                |
| the way to figure it out   |        |              |        |                |
| would be to compare a      |        |              |        |                |
| dmesg log from 11.04 with  |        |              |        |                |
| one from 11.10  and see    |        |              |        |                |
| which drivers changed      |        |              |        |                |
| thanks will try that       |        |              |        |                |

| i think one of the reasons | -0.021 | 0.450        | 0.320  | 11.100         |
| why the install from       |        |              |        |                |
| livecd is failing is maybe |        |              |        |                |
| because the default hda1   |        |              |        |                |
| is ~1gb  and it is filling |        |              |        |                |
| up before completing the   |        |              |        |                |
| install . it seems to fill |        |              |        |                |
| up to 100% exactly  which  |        |              |        |                |
| leads me to believe it 's  |        |              |        |                |
| not downloading everything |        |              |        |                |
| because there isn't enough |        |              |        |                |
| space does anyone know how |        |              |        |                |
| to resize partitions when  |        |              |        |                |
| running off the livecd (   |        |              |        |                |
| without reboot obviously)  |        |              |        |                |
| ? i'm sorta a linux noob   |        |              |        |                |
| so any help is appreciated |        |              |        |                |
| gparted i think livecds    |        |              |        |                |
| run exclusively in swap    |        |              |        |                |
| is there any way to resize |        |              |        |                |
| swap partitions on the fly |        |              |        |                |
| ? it doesn't seem like you |        |              |        |                |
| can from gparted           |        |              |        |                |

| i've never even heard of . |        |              |        |                |
| do a gcc **unknown** at a  |        |              |        |                |

| have a very recent version |        |              |        |                |

| it'd be possible to ( for  |        |              |        |                |

| strong suspicion you can   |        |              |        |                |
| tell the ubuntu installer  |        |              |        |                |
| to clobber one of your     |        |              |        |                |
| existing partitions and    |        |              |        |                |
| it'll do the right thing . |        |              |        |                |
| i hope so p not much wrong |        |              |        |                |
| with xp maintained right p |        |              |        |                |
| i'll admit i don't         |        |              |        |                |
| maintain it . even when it |        |              |        |                |
| was fresh  it took         |        |              |        |                |

| hi i installed ubuntu in a | 0.244  | 0.636        | 0.857  | 14.600         |
| virtual box as a demo      |        |              |        |                |
| server for our application |        |              |        |                |
| but i'd like the thing to  |        |              |        |                |
| be able to be copied and   |        |              |        |                |
| started on any network the |        |              |        |                |
| thing is i can accesss     |        |              |        |                |
| eth0 only if i delete      |        |              |        |                |
| everything in 70           |        |              |        |                |
| -persistent-net . rules    |        |              |        |                |
| and some users seams to    |        |              |        |                |
| find this to be too much   |        |              |        |                |
| trouble is there a way to  |        |              |        |                |
| automaticly do this or     |        |              |        |                |

| could delete that before   |        |              |        |                |
| you copy it thats the way  |        |              |        |                |

| soooooo bugged in 9.10 you |        |              |        |                |
| should have been around    |        |              |        |                |
| with opensuse about 3-4    |        |              |        |                |

| dependency handling the    |        |              |        |                |
| ones in your home folder ? |        |              |        |                |
| nor it should ... i        |        |              |        |                |
| thought purge should       |        |              |        |                |
| remove configuration files |        |              |        |                |
| and it is what differs it  |        |              |        |                |
| from regular removing it   |        |              |        |                |
| should files from your     |        |              |        |                |
| home folder are user       |        |              |        |                |
| specific purge removes     |        |              |        |                |
| system configuration files |        |              |        |                |
| not user config files      |        |              |        |                |
| otherwise how would it     |        |              |        |                |
| handle when you have more  |        |              |        |                |
| than one user ? i deleted  |        |              |        |                |
| pidgin i my machine and    |        |              |        |                |

| configuration files too    |        |              |        |                |

| second line is the number  |        |              |        |                |
| if you ignore the          |        |              |        |                |

| you disregard the memory   |        |              |        |                |
| used for buffers .. that   |        |              |        |                |
| 's ok ok . so i can leave  |        |              |        |                |
| ' low-memory ' as a cause  |        |              |        |                |
| for freezing computer then |        |              |        |                |

| this session  to rule out  |        |              |        |                |
| if it was a firefox/flash  |        |              |        |                |
| problem . you might want   |        |              |        |                |
| to run the memory testing  |        |              |        |                |
| thing as well .. bad       |        |              |        |                |
| memory can do weird things |        |              |        |                |
| to a machine .. how do i   |        |              |        |                |
| do that ? when you boot    |        |              |        |                |
| the machine there 's a     |        |              |        |                |
| grub menu ( you might need |        |              |        |                |
| to press esc during boot   |        |              |        |                |
| to show it) .. in that     |        |              |        |                |
| meny there 's an option to |        |              |        |                |
| run a memory test .. just  |        |              |        |                |
| leave that running until   |        |              |        |                |
| it 's gone through all     |        |              |        |                |
| your memory phlak_user ah  |        |              |        |                |
| right . i'll do that as    |        |              |        |                |
| soon as the backup is done |        |              |        |                |
| . i nothing else works     |        |              |        |                |
| i'll reload the computer . |        |              |        |                |

| be a stripped down version |        |              |        |                |

| move to universe thats     |        |              |        |                |
| good  less work for the    |        |              |        |                |
| core devs                  |        |              |        |                |

| i have 4 ocz drives . the  | 0.588  | 0.638        | 0.807  | 4.400          |
| only problem they have is  |        |              |        |                |
| when the pc sleeps or      |        |              |        |                |
| hibernates . they have     |        |              |        |                |
| released firmware updates  |        |              |        |                |
| for that  but these days i |        |              |        |                |
| just dont use them in pcs  |        |              |        |                |
| that sleep to be safe do i |        |              |        |                |
| need to make attention how |        |              |        |                |
| to partition the drive ? i |        |              |        |                |
| have 16gb ram but          |        |              |        |                |
| specifies 4gb of swap in   |        |              |        |                |
| the beginning of the       |        |              |        |                |
| driver  rest is / for data |        |              |        |                |
| if you allow the os or     |        |              |        |                |
| gparted to partition  it   |        |              |        |                |
| will be correct . as long  |        |              |        |                |
| as its a current os . i    |        |              |        |                |
| think ubuntu 11.10 on up   |        |              |        |                |
| or windows 7 on up be sure |        |              |        |                |
| to update the ssd drive 's |        |              |        |                |
| fireware                   |        |              |        |                |

| must be some gpl voip      |        |              |        |                |
| software for linux surely  |        |              |        |                |
| ? something u just use the |        |              |        |                |
| ip address as the calling  |        |              |        |                |
| number ? is asterisk also  |        |              |        |                |

| windows  mac  bsd ...      |        |              |        |                |
| gnomemeeting does that     |        |              |        |                |
| asterisk is really a       |        |              |        |                |
| server/switch which you    |        |              |        |                |
| attach a voip client to .  |        |              |        |                |
| i will wait to see gaim    |        |              |        |                |
| which is universal sounds  |        |              |        |                |
| cool                       |        |              |        |                |

| hey guys...i'm having some | -0.061 | 0.349        | -0.248 | 5.600          |
| problems with my           |        |              |        |                |
| partitions being assigned  |        |              |        |                |
| different device names (   |        |              |        |                |
| sda  sdb  sdc ) when i     |        |              |        |                |
| boot up . none of these    |        |              |        |                |
| devices have uuid's they   |        |              |        |                |
| are referred to by the old |        |              |        |                |
| style . do you think this  |        |              |        |                |
| is the problem ? i used to |        |              |        |                |
| have that problem with usb |        |              |        |                |
| drives ... i made explicit |        |              |        |                |
| udev entries for them and  |        |              |        |                |
| they stuck not sure if     |        |              |        |                |
| that applies to your       |        |              |        |                |
| situation hmm ... none of  |        |              |        |                |
| these are usb devices      |        |              |        |                |
| though . it might still    |        |              |        |                |
| apply ? the same trick     |        |              |        |                |
| might be useful . the usb  |        |              |        |                |
| devices are /dev/sd* too   |        |              |        |                |
| ... how exactly do i do it |        |              |        |                |
| ? google for udev howto or |        |              |        |                |
| udev tutorial - you'll     |        |              |        |                |
| just be adding one line to |        |              |        |                |
| a udev conf file i can't   |        |              |        |                |
| remember precisely ok      |        |              |        |                |
| i'll try that . thanks .   |        |              |        |                |
| the basic process is :     |        |              |        |                |
| looking in /sys for some   |        |              |        |                |
| identifying info about the |        |              |        |                |
| devices and then adding a  |        |              |        |                |
| line that maps that info   |        |              |        |                |
| to a device node good luck |        |              |        |                |

| kde4 is really bloated ... |        |              |        |                |
| i have read the same       |        |              |        |                |
| things about that . that   |        |              |        |                |
| gnome is faster and such . |        |              |        |                |
| i'm using it atm  but i    |        |              |        |                |
| can't get global shortcuts |        |              |        |                |

| it my defult . i think     |        |              |        |                |
| now i could be wrong  but  |        |              |        |                |
| i think you can change it  |        |              |        |                |
| by using this command ""   |        |              |        |                |
| gksudo gedit **unknown** . |        |              |        |                |
| list "" and then editing   |        |              |        |                |
| some options . so many     |        |              |        |                |
| entries to edit t_t no     |        |              |        |                |
| problem . i think if you   |        |              |        |                |
| find the **unknown**       |        |              |        |                |
| sections  and change the   |        |              |        |                |
| "" rhythmbox . desktop ""  |        |              |        |                |
| to "" amarok . desktop ""  |        |              |        |                |
| you should be good . only  |        |              |        |                |
| change the variabled that  |        |              |        |                |
| are after the = sign . try |        |              |        |                |
| that  see what happens .   |        |              |        |                |
| if it does not work        |        |              |        |                |
| changing them back might   |        |              |        |                |
| be a good idea . and of    |        |              |        |                |
| course save the file when  |        |              |        |                |
| you are done . :p forgot   |        |              |        |                |
| that almost . i'll try     |        |              |        |                |

| dying ? possibly  i'll     |        |              |        |                |
| have to look into that     |        |              |        |                |

| place to post about a      |        |              |        |                |
| making a gis flavor of     |        |              |        |                |
| ubuntu ( assuming there is |        |              |        |                |
| not already one ) gis ?    |        |              |        |                |
| geographical information   |        |              |        |                |
| systems what do you mean   |        |              |        |                |
| by a gis flavour of ubuntu |        |              |        |                |
| ? what needs to be changed |        |              |        |                |
| i mean one which is        |        |              |        |                |
| configured with apps etc   |        |              |        |                |
| specifically for doing gis |        |              |        |                |
| work like how there is the |        |              |        |                |
| studio version make your   |        |              |        |                |
| own  it seems a bit        |        |              |        |                |
| pointless though unless    |        |              |        |                |
| kernel tweaks are made one |        |              |        |                |
| of the drivers behind      |        |              |        |                |
| ubuntu studio is the real  |        |              |        |                |
| time kernel patch  so      |        |              |        |                |
| unless your idea needs     |        |              |        |                |
| changes like that it seems |        |              |        |                |
| pointless to build another |        |              |        |                |
| version thats just ubuntu  |        |              |        |                |
| with specific apps         |        |              |        |                |
| installed by default i am  |        |              |        |                |
| not sure right now i just  |        |              |        |                |
| thought it might be nice   |        |              |        |                |
| for setting up a computer  |        |              |        |                |
| lab                        |        |              |        |                |

| if you are trying ubuntu   | -0.046 | 0.470        | 0.307  | 7.900          |
| for the first time i don't |        |              |        |                |
| think it matters which fs  |        |              |        |                |
| you use . i'am going to    |        |              |        |                |
| switch from suse in suse   |        |              |        |                |
| updates system is          |        |              |        |                |
| completely unstable well   |        |              |        |                |
| new versions of suse are   |        |              |        |                |
| very stable distributions  |        |              |        |                |
| . ubuntu is stable too .   |        |              |        |                |
| however if you have        |        |              |        |                |
| stability in mind go with  |        |              |        |                |
| seveas advice and choose   |        |              |        |                |
| ext3 as filesystem . the   |        |              |        |                |
| base system is on the cd   |        |              |        |                |
| you can download .         |        |              |        |                |
| additional packages can be |        |              |        |                |
| retrieved via network but  |        |              |        |                |
| the applications on the cd |        |              |        |                |
| are the most needed ones   |        |              |        |                |
| so unless you have a very  |        |              |        |                |
| abstract taste of packages |        |              |        |                |
| installed you are going to |        |              |        |                |
| need the packages on the   |        |              |        |                |
| cd anyway .                |        |              |        |                |

| file ? like the file you   |        |              |        |                |
| would use to run vmware ?  |        |              |        |                |
| but you can't find it on   |        |              |        |                |
| your computer ? did you    |        |              |        |                |
| download it from the       |        |              |        |                |
| vmware site ? yes go to    |        |              |        |                |
| the terminal and type this |        |              |        |                |
| : find ~/ | grep bundle i  |        |              |        |                |
| am sure there is a better  |        |              |        |                |
| way to do this through the |        |              |        |                |
| graphical interface  but i |        |              |        |                |
| am a console man . i       |        |              |        |                |
| started using linux when   |        |              |        |                |
| the console was the        |        |              |        |                |
| fastest way to do things   |        |              |        |                |
| so i am used to it now .   |        |              |        |                |
| you shoudl be able to just |        |              |        |                |
| run : sudo filename .      |        |              |        |                |
| bundle  if you cant run it |        |              |        |                |
| you'll have to make it     |        |              |        |                |
| executable first : chmod   |        |              |        |                |
| 770 filename . bundle  of  |        |              |        |                |
| course you replace the     |        |              |        |                |
| filename with the one you  |        |              |        |                |
| found . listen to iceroot  |        |              |        |                |
| :) chmod +x is a safer     |        |              |        |                |
| option than 770 . make     |        |              |        |                |
| sure you are in the path   |        |              |        |                |
| of the file  or you        |        |              |        |                |
| include it : sudo          |        |              |        |                |

| bundle if it doesn't       |        |              |        |                |
| execute : chmod +x         |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** 6.5 .          |        |              |        |                |

| bundle  then try the first |        |              |        |                |
| command again . the vmware |        |              |        |                |
| install is pretty          |        |              |        |                |
| intensive .                |        |              |        |                |

| in the kernel  though i    |        |              |        |                |
| think in 2.6 i've had      |        |              |        |                |
| trouble getting my xircom  |        |              |        |                |
| to work . is xircom a      |        |              |        |                |
| chipset or brand name ? of |        |              |        |                |
| course those may work ..   |        |              |        |                |
| could be the code he has   |        |              |        |                |
| is very old and not even   |        |              |        |                |
| riht any more my guess is  |        |              |        |                |
| that **unknown** 's xircom |        |              |        |                |
| is too old to work with    |        |              |        |                |
| those _cb drivers  though  |        |              |        |                |

| character yeah .           |        |              |        |                |
| installing linux nixed my  |        |              |        |                |
| windows partition sure     |        |              |        |                |
| about that ??? anywa  too  |        |              |        |                |

| seems like your script     |        |              |        |                |
| writes results . log to    |        |              |        |                |

| directory is and it fails  |        |              |        |                |
| if it can't. so either     |        |              |        |                |
| change your script to not  |        |              |        |                |
| fail if it can't write     |        |              |        |                |
| results . log or make sure |        |              |        |                |
| you run your script from   |        |              |        |                |
| somewhere where you can    |        |              |        |                |
| write to is there a way to |        |              |        |                |
| specify that it writes     |        |              |        |                |
| results . log to the same  |        |              |        |                |

| **unknown** : after i did  |        |              |        |                |
| that ' utc ' thing to my   |        |              |        |                |
| laptop is when it stopped  |        |              |        |                |
| letting me adjust the      |        |              |        |                |
| clock and crashing in      |        |              |        |                |
| linux **unknown** : does   |        |              |        |                |
| it ever happen that the '  |        |              |        |                |

| checked in order for linux |        |              |        |                |
| and winxp to have the same |        |              |        |                |
| time ? you can change it   |        |              |        |                |
| so linux doesn't use utc   |        |              |        |                |
| that just means it follows |        |              |        |                |

| video player yes all files |        |              |        |                |
| . vlc will work perfectly  |        |              |        |                |
| so its just mplayer ? hmm  |        |              |        |                |
| ... yeah it is the         |        |              |        |                |

| something i will notice    |        |              |        |                |
| about vlc is that          |        |              |        |                |
| sometimes the sound will   |        |              |        |                |
| turn off intermittently    |        |              |        |                |
| what is your default sound |        |              |        |                |
| audio device in mplayer >  |        |              |        |                |

| can get that problem out   |        |              |        |                |

| integrate vlc with mozilla |        |              |        |                |

| understand it  -- host is  |        |              |        |                |
| like -- target **unknown** |        |              |        |                |
| -- host is different then  |        |              |        |                |
| -- build but fiy           |        |              |        |                |

| after i use xmms2 i can't  | -0.210 | 0.331        | -0.819 | 6.400          |
| make work some programs    |        |              |        |                |
| that use audio does        |        |              |        |                |
| anybody know why is that ? |        |              |        |                |
| probably pulseaudio - alsa |        |              |        |                |
| fuckup . should i shutdown |        |              |        |                |
| pulseaudio and restart it  |        |              |        |                |
| again ?? set to same in    |        |              |        |                |
| audio config me thinks     |        |              |        |                |
| xmms2 uses alsa problem is |        |              |        |                |
| that  i think its          |        |              |        |                |
| pulseaudio that locks the  |        |              |        |                |
| audio so alsa can't use it |        |              |        |                |
| ok  and the solution is to |        |              |        |                |
| change xmms2 conf to not   |        |              |        |                |
| use pulseaudio ? just kill |        |              |        |                |
| pulseaudio ok i'll try     |        |              |        |                |
| that or set all your audio |        |              |        |                |
| drivers to alsa thanks !   |        |              |        |                |

| correct its a local        | -0.280 | 0.500        | -0.952 | 5.200          |
| function and what about    |        |              |        |                |
| mounting home directories  |        |              |        |                |
| from my server ? how can i |        |              |        |                |
| accomplish that ?          |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** can't do that  |        |              |        |                |
| yes ? i need to mount      |        |              |        |                |
| whole /home from my file   |        |              |        |                |
| server ? or is it possible |        |              |        |                |
| to mount just logged in    |        |              |        |                |
| users home directories ?   |        |              |        |                |
| you can mount it e.g. with |        |              |        |                |
| nfs but with nfs you must  |        |              |        |                |
| use ldap . because nfs is  |        |              |        |                |
| not checking the uid which |        |              |        |                |
| will mess up the system if |        |              |        |                |
| you have different uids    |        |              |        |                |
| for the same user so i     |        |              |        |                |
| need just to mount /home   |        |              |        |                |
| at boot time and it should |        |              |        |                |
| just work  if uids are     |        |              |        |                |
| correct ? yes but think of |        |              |        |                |
| he case when the server is |        |              |        |                |
| not reachable whan pam     |        |              |        |                |
| can't authenticate through |        |              |        |                |
| ldap it should try local   |        |              |        |                |
| passwd  yes ? yes but i    |        |              |        |                |
| spoke about the case you   |        |              |        |                |
| cant mount your homes so   |        |              |        |                |
| only solution i see for    |        |              |        |                |
| now is to create one local |        |              |        |                |
| user on every desktop a    |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** user yes  i am |        |              |        |                |
| doing that on my ldap-     |        |              |        |                |
| based systems to  just for |        |              |        |                |
| the case of problems if    |        |              |        |                |
| you are using this  can    |        |              |        |                |
| you say something about    |        |              |        |                |
| nfs vs sshfs ? i am only   |        |              |        |                |
| using nfs sorry and nfs    |        |              |        |                |
| works without problems ?   |        |              |        |                |

| thing you're thinking of ? |        |              |        |                |
| - well  sort of ... but i  |        |              |        |                |
| dont use linux at work     |        |              |        |                |
| besides for my personal    |        |              |        |                |
| troubleshooting reasons .  |        |              |        |                |
| :( suppose you could also  |        |              |        |                |
| try a kickstart network    |        |              |        |                |
| but so far for me that 's  |        |              |        |                |
| bit a bit of a troublesome |        |              |        |                |
| thing to get happy         |        |              |        |                |

| eh  that 's fine  it 's    | -0.425 | 0.500        | -0.507 | 16.500         |
| probably just a problem    |        |              |        |                |
| with firestarter though    |        |              |        |                |

| probably blocking the 360  |        |              |        |                |
| 's connection  you need to |        |              |        |                |
| find out what ports or     |        |              |        |                |
| stuff the 360 needs and    |        |              |        |                |
| open / allow those ports   |        |              |        |                |
| and stuff it can't even    |        |              |        |                |
| gain a ip though           |        |              |        |                |

| folder . should i do that  |        |              |        |                |
| too ? or would it be       |        |              |        |                |
| redundant to encrypt that  |        |              |        |                |

| also copies skel does it ? |        |              |        |                |
| hmm . well  if you add the |        |              |        |                |
| -m option that is  but it  |        |              |        |                |
| seems to me the problem is |        |              |        |                |
| that it 's not actually    |        |              |        |                |

| completion should work . i |        |              |        |                |
| meant my fix in addition   |        |              |        |                |
| to yours  i don't think i  |        |              |        |                |

| u can install windows      | 0.703  | 0.471        | 0.962  | 49.700         |
| second if you use supergub |        |              |        |                |
| to get ubuntu back on the  |        |              |        |                |
| boot screen imo i still    |        |              |        |                |
| think windows is better    |        |              |        |                |
| simply because so many     |        |              |        |                |
| apps are still developed   |        |              |        |                |
| for it but ubuntu runs way |        |              |        |                |
| better and is a lot cooler |        |              |        |                |
| but no one makes great     |        |              |        |                |
| apps for ubuntu vmware     |        |              |        |                |
| works better on windows    |        |              |        |                |
| lol games lol but you see  |        |              |        |                |
| if ubuntu becomes main     |        |              |        |                |
| steam then it will become  |        |              |        |                |
| just like windows soon     |        |              |        |                |
| ubuntu will be full of     |        |              |        |                |
| auto loginscripts and auto |        |              |        |                |
| sudio password scripts     |        |              |        |                |
| viruses will have no       |        |              |        |                |
| problem at all people      |        |              |        |                |
| wouldn't use it if it      |        |              |        |                |
| stops working well there   |        |              |        |                |
| are dozens of other        |        |              |        |                |
| distros the only reason    |        |              |        |                |
| any of that would happen   |        |              |        |                |
| is if people use it a lot  |        |              |        |                |

| hi . anyone having tried   | 0.221  | 0.488        | 0.238  | 12.200         |
| ubuntu on old **unknown**  |        |              |        |                |
| ? 1 ghz and 394 mb i was   |        |              |        |                |
| wondering if the last      |        |              |        |                |
| edition would be too       |        |              |        |                |
| bloated for that machine   |        |              |        |                |
| you better run xubuntu (   |        |              |        |                |
| xfce desktop ) or fluxbox  |        |              |        |                |
| on that xubuntu comes with |        |              |        |                |
| minimal gnome services by  |        |              |        |                |
| default it has some gnome  |        |              |        |                |
| libs  but most of the gui  |        |              |        |                |
| apps are gtk2 only i       |        |              |        |                |
| recently read something    |        |              |        |                |
| about xfce not being so    |        |              |        |                |
| light in modern versions   |        |              |        |                |
| ... that 's why i use xfce |        |              |        |                |
| with fluxbox windowmanager |        |              |        |                |
| i installed normal xubuntu |        |              |        |                |
| then added fluxbox and run |        |              |        |                |
| a fluxbox session from gdm |        |              |        |                |
| login                      |        |              |        |                |

| does not show the wireless |        |              |        |                |
| card itself loading ...    |        |              |        |                |
| i'm not sure if this is a  |        |              |        |                |
| problem with **unknown**   |        |              |        |                |
| or modprobe though and my  |        |              |        |                |
| first guess was that       |        |              |        |                |
| modprobe wasn't loading it |        |              |        |                |
| right ... but somewhere i  |        |              |        |                |
| read about lshw and tried  |        |              |        |                |
| it and found that it said  |        |              |        |                |
| ' disabled ' for my        |        |              |        |                |
| wireless card lshw lists   |        |              |        |                |
| hardware connected to the  |        |              |        |                |
| computer  and that doesnt  |        |              |        |                |
| necessarily mean that the  |        |              |        |                |
| device is configured right |        |              |        |                |
| ( as the "" disabled ""    |        |              |        |                |
| there might indicate ) ..  |        |              |        |                |
| i should think you need to |        |              |        |                |
| go back and verify         |        |              |        |                |
| ndiswrapper again if i do  |        |              |        |                |

| onboard cards are usually  |        |              |        |                |
| conencted upto the pci bus |        |              |        |                |
| .. but is entirely         |        |              |        |                |
| plausible that your is     |        |              |        |                |
| connected upto the usb bus |        |              |        |                |
| ( quite unlikely tho )     |        |              |        |                |
| ndiswrapper -l tells you   |        |              |        |                |
| well that is right and it  |        |              |        |                |
| shows it as present ( both |        |              |        |                |
| hardware and driver ) but  |        |              |        |                |
| it still isn't working :(  |        |              |        |                |
| i'm not sure if you        |        |              |        |                |
| remember helping me        |        |              |        |                |
| earlier but i found out    |        |              |        |                |
| that the wireless card     |        |              |        |                |
| that was showing up was    |        |              |        |                |
| using the wrong drivers (  |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** ) and had to   |        |              |        |                |
| be removed when i did so   |        |              |        |                |
| eth1 did not show up       |        |              |        |                |
| anymore  and i follow the  |        |              |        |                |
| howtos step by step until  |        |              |        |                |
| it gets to the part where  |        |              |        |                |
| you get on network-admin   |        |              |        |                |
| ... i can never find the   |        |              |        |                |
| wlan :( errm  now thats a  |        |              |        |                |
| real issue -- ndiswrapper  |        |              |        |                |
| has known to list loaded   |        |              |        |                |
| drivers/hardware but the   |        |              |        |                |
| device doesnt come online  |        |              |        |                |
| because of a driver        |        |              |        |                |
| mismatch -- ensure you     |        |              |        |                |
| have the right drivers i   |        |              |        |                |
| will try downloading the   |        |              |        |                |
| drivers again from the hp  |        |              |        |                |
| 's site ... oh wait i just |        |              |        |                |
| remembered the drivers are |        |              |        |                |
| in an exe ... how would i  |        |              |        |                |
| extract them ? from ubuntu |        |              |        |                |
| you can use cabextract (   |        |              |        |                |
| and sometimes unzip ) ..   |        |              |        |                |
| from windows  winzip or    |        |              |        |                |
| winrar its not a self-     |        |              |        |                |
| extracting exe ... it uses |        |              |        |                |
| installshield i believe to |        |              |        |                |
| extract the files  then it |        |              |        |                |
| auto-runs the windows      |        |              |        |                |
| installer but then again   |        |              |        |                |
| not all . exes are self-   |        |              |        |                |
| extracting archives .. so  |        |              |        |                |
| you must then look at      |        |              |        |                |
| extracting the . inf and . |        |              |        |                |
| sys files from the windows |        |              |        |                |
| install have you tried     |        |              |        |                |
| uncompressing that . exe   |        |              |        |                |
| ?"                         |        |              |        |                |

| something like that floppy |        |              |        |                |
| distro w/3c574_cs driver)  |        |              |        |                |

| install ubuntu-desktop .   |        |              |        |                |

| it doesnt touch user       |        |              |        |                |

| crashing only with ubuntu  |        |              |        |                |

| have power management      |        |              |        |                |
| modules loaded sure hi     |        |              |        |                |
| sounds great . thanks !    |        |              |        |                |
| now i just have to decide  |        |              |        |                |
| if it 's worth it  but i   |        |              |        |                |
| think it is . i have 500w  |        |              |        |                |
| psu  but 400w should be    |        |              |        |                |
| fine . anything over 500$  |        |              |        |                |
| is nice to have via a      |        |              |        |                |
| power backup you would be  |        |              |        |                |
| amazed at the brown power  |        |              |        |                |
| & spikes that go through   |        |              |        |                |
| pc without one the problem |        |              |        |                |
| is i want one for two      |        |              |        |                |
| computer  preferable four  |        |              |        |                |
| but then it 's going to be |        |              |        |                |
| too expensive .            |        |              |        |                |

| apparently adobe has       | 0.175  | 0.398        | 0.869  | 17.300         |
| altered its flashplugin    |        |              |        |                |
| package ... apt-get        |        |              |        |                |
| wouldn't install it  and   |        |              |        |                |
| when tried manually the    |        |              |        |                |
| installer had an obvious   |        |              |        |                |
| bug with install path      |        |              |        |                |
| input  so i just copied    |        |              |        |                |
| the plugin . so manually   |        |              |        |                |
| let me rephrase that i let |        |              |        |                |
| the devels know whats      |        |              |        |                |
| wrong one of the flash     |        |              |        |                |
| guys need to fix it ( im   |        |              |        |                |
| not good with the scripts  |        |              |        |                |
| we use for flash ) its     |        |              |        |                |
| being looked into ok i     |        |              |        |                |
| think ubuntu script is ok  |        |              |        |                |
| but adobe  for some reason |        |              |        |                |
| has replaced the package   |        |              |        |                |
| the md5 sums mismatch  and |        |              |        |                |
| the adobe installer script |        |              |        |                |
| adds a redundant space to  |        |              |        |                |
| the install path string    |        |              |        |                |
| and refuses to install no  |        |              |        |                |
| its not flash packaged the |        |              |        |                |
| new one with the same      |        |              |        |                |
| named tar as older one the |        |              |        |                |
| script needs to be changed |        |              |        |                |
| to use the new one well    |        |              |        |                |
| yeah  but the contents     |        |              |        |                |
| aren't the same since the  |        |              |        |                |
| md5sums are not the same   |        |              |        |                |
| right ? right well  yes    |        |              |        |                |
| in that respect the ubuntu |        |              |        |                |
| script is out of date i    |        |              |        |                |
| spent 4+ hours fiddling    |        |              |        |                |
| with that last night       |        |              |        |                |
| trying to find _best_ way  |        |              |        |                |
| to solve it heh :) no its  |        |              |        |                |
| doing it correctly but     |        |              |        |                |
| adobe isnt gonna change so |        |              |        |                |
| we have to and there were  |        |              |        |                |
| alot of regressions in the |        |              |        |                |
| new version is why we      |        |              |        |                |
| didnt update it yet . we   |        |              |        |                |
| need to find out if the    |        |              |        |                |
| regressions were fixed     |        |              |        |                |
| before we update it or     |        |              |        |                |
| flash is broken anyway     |        |              |        |                |

| should report it to        |        |              |        |                |
| launchpad okay then        |        |              |        |                |
| cheers . it is a kernel    |        |              |        |                |
| bug so linux-image-generic |        |              |        |                |
| is the buggy package do    |        |              |        |                |
| you have any other reason  |        |              |        |                |
| to think the filesystem    |        |              |        |                |
| may be corrupted ? have    |        |              |        |                |

| only /home has that error  |        |              |        |                |
| then the fs should be ok   |        |              |        |                |
| and you should report the  |        |              |        |                |
| kernel bug home is a       |        |              |        |                |

| with ubuntu . there are    |        |              |        |                |
| ppa 's for later versions  |        |              |        |                |

| recommend them - you       |        |              |        |                |

| square one with sound  im  |        |              |        |                |
| not getting sound from ff  |        |              |        |                |
| or chrome i think if you   |        |              |        |                |
| want to stick with ubuntu  |        |              |        |                |
| the best thing you can do  |        |              |        |                |
| is crack open the case     |        |              |        |                |
| pull out the x-fi and put  |        |              |        |                |
| in any old generic sound   |        |              |        |                |

| above it will be loaded at |        |              |        |                |
| the bottom ... use :       |        |              |        |                |
| gksudo gedit /etc/modules  |        |              |        |                |
| and add the line no  thats |        |              |        |                |
| a list of modules to load  |        |              |        |                |
| at boot  so just add the   |        |              |        |                |
| word : ndiswrapper on its  |        |              |        |                |
| own line the next          |        |              |        |                |
| available line save the    |        |              |        |                |
| file  close gedit  reboot  |        |              |        |                |
| to test i want to add the  |        |              |        |                |
| file but it says read-only |        |              |        |                |
| thats becuase you only     |        |              |        |                |
| opened it in a text edito  |        |              |        |                |
| **unknown** told you how   |        |              |        |                |
| to open it correctly so    |        |              |        |                |
| you mustve missed it or    |        |              |        |                |
| ignored me  scroll up quit |        |              |        |                |
| using that  you'll break   |        |              |        |                |
| your system run : gksudo   |        |              |        |                |
| gedit /etc/modules thats   |        |              |        |                |
| the right way to get write |        |              |        |                |
| access with gedit to files |        |              |        |                |
| you don't normally have    |        |              |        |                |
| access to if you do what i |        |              |        |                |
| say  it will work  its     |        |              |        |                |
| really that simple yeah i  |        |              |        |                |
| just added the line ok     |        |              |        |                |
| svae the file  close gedit |        |              |        |                |
| and reboot to test let me  |        |              |        |                |
| reboot then . if you       |        |              |        |                |
| follow guides given it'll  |        |              |        |                |

| says i'll need 1.2 gb for  |        |              |        |                |
| this :p i'm more concerned |        |              |        |                |
| about not having all kinds |        |              |        |                |
| of confusing things on the |        |              |        |                |
| desktop next step i'm      |        |              |        |                |
| planning is to arrange     |        |              |        |                |
| things according to the    |        |              |        |                |
| way i find logical the     |        |              |        |                |
| default ubuntu desktop     |        |              |        |                |
| distribution have all      |        |              |        |                |
| kinds of things installed  |        |              |        |                |
| in x by default and the    |        |              |        |                |
| placement is confusing to  |        |              |        |                |
| me  i.e. finding terminal  |        |              |        |                |
| inside accessories instead |        |              |        |                |
| of system tools :d ubuntu- |        |              |        |                |
| desktop is the entire      |        |              |        |                |
| desktop package  all the   |        |              |        |                |
| programs  etc not          |        |              |        |                |
| necessarily . but you'd    |        |              |        |                |
| need to **unknown** them   |        |              |        |                |
| yourself . and  you can    |        |              |        |                |
| get ' just ' gnome  or     |        |              |        |                |
| whatever too . how do you  |        |              |        |                |
| do that ? via apt  just    |        |              |        |                |
| install the packages       |        |              |        |                |
| they're meta packages      |        |              |        |                |
| they'll install the        |        |              |        |                |
| dependencies  etc that 's  |        |              |        |                |

| has a blank screen with a  |        |              |        |                |
| cursor that does nothing   |        |              |        |                |
| until you install other    |        |              |        |                |
| stuff ontop of x i figured |        |              |        |                |
| that i need a windows      |        |              |        |                |

| server i think . the thing |        |              |        |                |
| that takes www.google.com  |        |              |        |                |
| and makes it an ip address |        |              |        |                |
| . wastrel could very well  |        |              |        |                |
| be right as well . i       |        |              |        |                |
| believe i have the         |        |              |        |                |
| function correct anyway .  |        |              |        |                |
| but if that 's broken -    |        |              |        |                |
| hoe can i be accessing the |        |              |        |                |

| one of them . i'd          |        |              |        |                |
| definitely recommend       |        |              |        |                |

| gstreamer . does freenode  |        |              |        |                |
| not use a proxy blacklist  |        |              |        |                |
| ? synaptic is a front end  |        |              |        |                |
| to apt-get  afaik right    |        |              |        |                |
| that 's what i thought     |        |              |        |                |
| that it used apt-get       |        |              |        |                |
| rather than aptitude . i   |        |              |        |                |
| have to say aptitude in    |        |              |        |                |
| itself is quite nice       |        |              |        |                |
| though .                   |        |              |        |                |

| reboot now . ( it seems    |        |              |        |                |
| that it 's the fsck which  |        |              |        |                |
| made it work  because i    |        |              |        |                |

| mainly because 4162 is the |        |              |        |                |
| latest build of irrlicht   |        |              |        |                |

| and is also easier ) to    |        |              |        |                |
| use that if there is no    |        |              |        |                |
| specific reason to use     |        |              |        |                |
| 4099 : in the reply i got  |        |              |        |                |
| they specified me not to   |        |              |        |                |
| use the latest one but     |        |              |        |                |

| cups is no longer stating  |        |              |        |                |
| on boot . so i have to     |        |              |        |                |
| manualy start cups . can   |        |              |        |                |
| someone help me out ? you  |        |              |        |                |
| can find cups startup      |        |              |        |                |
| setting at **unknown** i   |        |              |        |                |
| just saw that im currently |        |              |        |                |
| in the runlevel unknown :p |        |              |        |                |
| if this point out to a bug |        |              |        |                |
| which version are you      |        |              |        |                |
| using ? normal runlevel is |        |              |        |                |
| 2 ubuntu 10.04 i believe i |        |              |        |                |
| must have previously been  |        |              |        |                |
| using runlevel 2 since     |        |              |        |                |
| before this monday         |        |              |        |                |
| everything wasd fine .     |        |              |        |                |
| after multiple reboot i am |        |              |        |                |
| always in runlevel unknown |        |              |        |                |
| . which is why cups does   |        |              |        |                |
| not start . it can't       |        |              |        |                |
| process the runlevel       |        |              |        |                |
| script . sshd also does    |        |              |        |                |
| not start same thing as    |        |              |        |                |
| cups yes  you are right    |        |              |        |                |
| it 's a bug **unknown** *  |        |              |        |                |
| upgrade upstart  my system |        |              |        |                |
| is already up to date from |        |              |        |                |
| what i understand ... can  |        |              |        |                |
| you switch to runlevel 2 ? |        |              |        |                |

| i should post such a       |        |              |        |                |
| question ( as the one i    |        |              |        |                |
| did above) ? you didnt ask |        |              |        |                |
| a question you made a      |        |              |        |                |
| statement like i said      |        |              |        |                |
| thats not really a         |        |              |        |                |
| question yes ! that 's     |        |              |        |                |
| actually the command that  |        |              |        |                |
| got me into trouble . now  |        |              |        |                |
| i boot into the partition  |        |              |        |                |
| and get nothing sudo dpkg- |        |              |        |                |
| reconfigure xorg can i do  |        |              |        |                |
| that externally ? as in    |        |              |        |                |
| ... w/a live cd  and       |        |              |        |                |
| specify that command^ be   |        |              |        |                |
| implimented onto the       |        |              |        |                |
| partition in trouble you   |        |              |        |                |
| should be able to still    |        |              |        |                |
| get a console screen from  |        |              |        |                |
| your existing install i    |        |              |        |                |
| assume you mean chaning    |        |              |        |                |
| session type before        |        |              |        |                |
| logging in  however -      |        |              |        |                |
| after choosing my boot     |        |              |        |                |
| selection in grub  nothing |        |              |        |                |
| happens - just a black     |        |              |        |                |
| screen sounds like you the |        |              |        |                |
| system isnt booting at all |        |              |        |                |
| okay - so what i did       |        |              |        |                |
| shouldn't be causing this  |        |              |        |                |
| kind of result ? it must   |        |              |        |                |
| be something else ? (      |        |              |        |                |
| because the xp partition   |        |              |        |                |
| sitting on the same drive  |        |              |        |                |
| boots fine from grub )     |        |              |        |                |
| yeah exactly it should be  |        |              |        |                |
| quite easy to fix if it    |        |              |        |                |
| was merely a mis configure |        |              |        |                |

| i install a windws driver  |        |              |        |                |
| for my wifi card using     |        |              |        |                |
| ndiswrapper  but it wont   |        |              |        |                |
| connect to the router  and |        |              |        |                |
| the password i give it is  |        |              |        |                |
| the correct one            |        |              |        |                |
| ndiswrapper sometimes does |        |              |        |                |
| not work with encryption   |        |              |        |                |
| .. you may want to try a   |        |              |        |                |
| linux native driver ok     |        |              |        |                |
| zenxr ill try that the     |        |              |        |                |
| linux native driver dosent |        |              |        |                |
| work for me pastebin your  |        |              |        |                |
| lspci output - i may be    |        |              |        |                |
| able to point you in the   |        |              |        |                |
| right direction for the    |        |              |        |                |
| driver its a usb wifi card |        |              |        |                |
| then lsusb -- chances are  |        |              |        |                |
| though you should buy a    |        |              |        |                |
| compatible usb card        |        |              |        |                |

| is that to say ubuntu is   | 0.003  | 0.875        | 0.306  | 15.800         |
| only ubuntu if it has      |        |              |        |                |
| packages from the ubuntu   |        |              |        |                |
| repo ? ubuntu wouldn't be  |        |              |        |                |
| ubuntu if it was comprised |        |              |        |                |
| of packages not sourced    |        |              |        |                |
| from an ubuntu repository  |        |              |        |                |
| so yes - but that 's not   |        |              |        |                |
| the only factor in         |        |              |        |                |
| deciding the legitimacy of |        |              |        |                |
| ubuntu but it 's a major   |        |              |        |                |
| one of course it wouldn't  |        |              |        |                |
| i think you hit the nail   |        |              |        |                |
| on its head when you said  |        |              |        |                |
| that 's not the only       |        |              |        |                |

| system ( win 7  ubuntu     |        |              |        |                |
| 11.10 ) but the grub       |        |              |        |                |
| points to the recovery     |        |              |        |                |

| for a reason . ) you mean  |        |              |        |                |
| they love control because  |        |              |        |                |

| traffic and the spread of  |        |              |        |                |

| if that 's the case  then  |        |              |        |                |
| why let people use ie or   |        |              |        |                |
| use the norton av if       |        |              |        |                |
| they're so concerned about |        |              |        |                |
| their computers ' security |        |              |        |                |
| ? because ie comes         |        |              |        |                |
| standard on the computer   |        |              |        |                |
| and norton is good at      |        |              |        |                |
| sweet talking morons into  |        |              |        |                |
| think it is useful . then  |        |              |        |                |
| there 's a reasonable      |        |              |        |                |
| possibility that someone   |        |              |        |                |
| who wants to boot from usb |        |              |        |                |
| will do far much less      |        |              |        |                |
| damage than the owners of  |        |              |        |                |

| know . but how do i        |        |              |        |                |
| upgrade ? sudo apt-get     |        |              |        |                |
| install linux-image-       |        |              |        |                |

| way is using ssh if you    |        |              |        |                |
| want a real fast viewer    |        |              |        |                |
| for the x-server use nx    |        |              |        |                |
| its the fastest thing out  |        |              |        |                |

| session  nx is opening a   |        |              |        |                |
| new session is it easy to  |        |              |        |                |
| use nx ? its easy to use   |        |              |        |                |
| but not so easy to install |        |              |        |                |
| :) do you know where i can |        |              |        |                |
| find a good guide for      |        |              |        |                |

| sooo stupid the installer  |        |              |        |                |
| is terrible - the default  |        |              |        |                |
| action for the partitioner |        |              |        |                |
| is to wipe the entire disk |        |              |        |                |
| for ' next happy ' windows |        |              |        |                |
| users  this will hurt them |        |              |        |                |

| bit - just ask if it will  |        |              |        |                |
| install into say the 7th   |        |              |        |                |

| a pic of that one window   |        |              |        |                |
| by renaming that folder we |        |              |        |                |
| took all addons and        |        |              |        |                |
| everything that wasnt hard |        |              |        |                |
| installed in the system    |        |              |        |                |
| out . i recommend starting |        |              |        |                |
| a personal google docs for |        |              |        |                |
| chages lol you need that   |        |              |        |                |
| math google labs addon it  |        |              |        |                |
| quizes you to see if you   |        |              |        |                |
| can actually comprehend    |        |              |        |                |
| what your doing  ok andy   |        |              |        |                |
| we should port that to     |        |              |        |                |
| bash thats an excellent    |        |              |        |                |
| idea perhaps combine that  |        |              |        |                |
| with the system typing     |        |              |        |                |
| lock pacakge or modify     |        |              |        |                |
| sudo somehow to check what |        |              |        |                |
| time it is  then issue the |        |              |        |                |
| test if needed . can't you |        |              |        |                |
| just sudo apt-get purge    |        |              |        |                |
| firefox ?                  |        |              |        |                |

| partition on a hard disk ? |        |              |        |                |
| it looks like a floppy     |        |              |        |                |
| they are usually named     |        |              |        |                |

| perhaps easier ) boot from |        |              |        |                |
| a live cd . in any case    |        |              |        |                |

| when i install ubuntu      | -0.314 | 0.512        | -0.658 | 6.400          |
| does the installer copy    |        |              |        |                |
| drivers that are specific  |        |              |        |                |
| to my hardware  or do i    |        |              |        |                |
| get a standard setup of    |        |              |        |                |
| files ? the reason i ask   |        |              |        |                |
| is whether i can just move |        |              |        |                |
| the hdd to another         |        |              |        |                |
| computer ... you will get  |        |              |        |                |
| all the drivers copied to  |        |              |        |                |
| the harddisk  but the      |        |              |        |                |
| install itself will be     |        |              |        |                |
| tuned to the hardware you  |        |              |        |                |
| have at install time . so  |        |              |        |                |
| moving a hdd from one      |        |              |        |                |
| computer to another is not |        |              |        |                |
| likely to work very well ( |        |              |        |                |
| it *can* but most likely   |        |              |        |                |
| not ) ok . thanks ! you    |        |              |        |                |
| will probably be able to   |        |              |        |                |
| boot from it ( with a bit  |        |              |        |                |
| of luck ) but some         |        |              |        |                |
| configuration must be done |        |              |        |                |
| before networking and xorg |        |              |        |                |
| will work . no guarantees  |        |              |        |                |
| though ok  i recon the     |        |              |        |                |
| networking part is about   |        |              |        |                |
| dhcp vs . static and such  |        |              |        |                |
| whereas xorg is about gfx  |        |              |        |                |
| card drivers ...? that 's  |        |              |        |                |
| about what i was thinking  |        |              |        |                |
| . can be networking        |        |              |        |                |
| drivers as well . can also |        |              |        |                |
| be a problem if you move   |        |              |        |                |
| the hdd to another         |        |              |        |                |
| computer that already has  |        |              |        |                |
| got another hdd in it .    |        |              |        |                |
