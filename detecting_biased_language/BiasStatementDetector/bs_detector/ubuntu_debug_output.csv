hello , how can i copy a file from a remote host if you have ssh access you can use scp or sftp scp don't work for me he don't found the host can i use pastebin or some thing like that well to gain access to another host the name must resolve using dns , the host must be running the ssh server , and the firewalls must allow access how will you write the command when the user on a windows domain if the system holding the file is windows , you can't usually use ssh ( scp/sftp ) unless that server had an ssh server installed . you'll have to find another way ... probably using a windows share on the server and samba on the ubuntu pc i can shh to the machine , that 's not the problem if you can ssh you should be able to scp too !	0.5163336176	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	17.3	0	0	0	0	1	0.0066	0	0	7	0.0464	18	0.1192	7	0.0464	3	0.0199	11	0.0728	7	0.0464	11	0.0728	8	0.053	0	0	0.364	conditional	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.3583	83	0.9354	151
i need libqt4-dev so i went hunting in the software center for it . never popped up with a few different searh terms i used , but sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev worked fine . i wonder how many other packages don't show up when i'm hunting . apt-cache search libqt4-dev i meant in the software center though . i'll go in wondering if there might be any such and such , now i think that everything 's not showing up  before i just figured it wasn't there . software center isn't good for what you're trying to do . if you really want a gui that can accomplish that sort of thing try installing synaptic and using that . nice :-)	0.5049583673	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0.0085	0	0	5.6	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0.0254	11	0.0932	7	0.0593	3	0.0254	1	0.0085	9	0.0763	4	0.0339	12	0.1017	7	0.0593	1	0.0085	0.1204	conditional	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.4411	84	0.8842	118
hey warthogs should i have instant auto-mounting usb drive **unknown** happiness ? actually yes , if you use the latest packages i just tried it myself , does not work for me either . funny , it worked with **unknown** 's test package what do you use for testing ? i . e . what kind of device ? flash card watch , i think keybuk and daf have the same usb ? ah , i remember daf 's one . i did not test it at the conference yess does it have partitions ? ( or , at least , one ? ) yes hmm . seems like hal still needs a lot of work . can you see the thing in hal-device-manager ? there should be a device node with a proper name with a child node which is a volume yes that 's the device node . does it have any children , which are volumes ? with a rectangular gray box as icon the volumes should have a property block . **unknown** sorry , block . **unknown** is it 1 ? can you pmount it manually ? i . e . ' pmount /dev/sda1 ' ( it is sda1 , i suppose ) btw , do your hotplug usb drives finally work automatically ? last time we did not come to debug it . they are getting mounted correctly now , but nautilus isn't popping up to display the files does the device appear in the computer window ? it *could* be today 's update , depending on the type of device you have . but it 's good to hear that it works now works now , didn't this morning :-) good morning ! say , could you life with having icons at the desktop for automounted volumes ? ( see sounder ml ) no thanks icon in the panel ? yes , much better imho this is the only other sane approach imho its quite important to have an obvious and safe unmounting possibility , but bug fixing is important as well . no precedence on my side since i'm quite unfamiliar with gnome programming , i would rather concentrate on bug fixing and security review and have e.g. seb or npmccallum do this thing	0.4979044926	0	0	0	0	2	0.006	1	0.003	0	0	5.6	0	0	0	0	1	0.003	5	0.0151	10	0.0302	36	0.1088	4	0.0121	0	0	12	0.0363	8	0.0242	29	0.0876	11	0.0332	6	0.0181	0.2598	conditional	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5975	187	0.9867	331

hi wondering whether to use 32 or 64 bit how much ram does the pc have ? more than 2gb you might see advantages using the 64-bit installation . definitely use 64-bit then definitely ? because , i've heard that ubuntu recommends 32-bit and also that although 64 adds speed in some ways it is also slower than 32 in others - don't ask me how , i'm not technical , but apparently in a lot of cases it makes no difference . no , we recommend 64 bit and it will usually be faster since the 64-bit cpus have lots more bigger registers than 32-bit so can handle many more calculations without having to access ( slow ) ram well , i run it with 2gb or more and it feels better ... been using 64bit for several years now i recall there used to be issues with getting flash ? and stuff set up on 64-bit , but maybe we're beyond that now now debian and ubuntu have adopted multi-lib we can install the 32-bit libraries to support 32-bit applications on 64-bit without any silly kludges we had before excellent . that 's good to know - reassuring . thank you . :) check the specifications of the manufacturer	0.2808669393	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	9.1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0.005	16	0.08	15	0.075	10	0.05	2	0.01	18	0.09	0	0	24	0.12	11	0.055	0	0	0.4151	conditional	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.4882	132	0.9869	200
