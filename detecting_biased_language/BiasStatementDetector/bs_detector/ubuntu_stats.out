( because i played with it before i learned how to launch nvidia-settings ) yeah  it hasn't got the right video modes in there that i can . shut the gedit window  log in as root ( sudo -i ) and open the file with : nano -w /etc/x11/xorg . conf yes im pretty usre i reverted it right  that should be my original xorg ... please help me insert 1360 properly  i opened it with nano okay . scroll down the file with the arrow keys until you see the line : section "" screen "" then scroll down further until you see the line : depth 24 now  in the line after "" depth 24 "" you can see various modes ( 1024x768 ... ) add the mode you want at the start of the list add a new entry then modify it as seen here : **unknown** then save the file with ctrl-o and quit nano with ctrl-x undo on nano ? just shut the file with ctrl-x and open it again ctrl-x to close :) did it complain after you entered ctrl-o ? !!!!! error writing /etc/x11/xorg . conf : permission denied i will try again maybe i wasnt su or some thing yep . you need to be root to do that : sudo nano -w /etc/x11/xorg . conf what do i do after i saved it now see if it works . shut everything you're doing and log out and then back in again i have an idea . one second . oh  btw . can you paste your current /etc/x11/xorg . conf to pastebin so i can check it 's okay ? sorry i have to go i will be back online later i hope you are here !!!!!!!!!!!!!! my woman has arrived http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=400035 so sorry ih ave to go il be back later ok"
