okay -- likes:  thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
you weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as i can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
esdras is a jew.
i'm not a whore.  i'm not a whore.
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer.  here, here's a number of an immigration lawyer.  that's how you help her. but you can't get involved in her like that.  you're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  and lemme give you another piece of advice.  maybe you don't watch tv but i'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  and when you get out there, they know your face.  and the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  and i get more done because of it.
no, i don't think you were a fool, i just think you were stupid about it.  i mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  you don't know her well enough. she's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  you can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. you're dead.
you really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  how fuckin' stupid are you?
if he doesn't lower his gun i'll fucking kill her.
hey, tabloids paid ted bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  and how much you think monica got for writing book about the president coming on to her?  it pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. look, you want magazine or not?
you think you are a director?  you are a fucking little, small russian piece of shit.  and i hate you.  i fucking hate you.
and the whore's murder?  you didn't erase that either, did you?  don't lie, i won't be angry.
whore?
yeah, well the only woman of the indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet ... they both looked mad enough to kill him...
thanks for callin' in... and i guess maybe... look, i'm sorry i called you watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. i was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
i'm impressed with you too, jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
this sucks.  a maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. so, instead of me being where i oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, i'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
okay.  you're not a team player. you gotta do things your own way. fine.  nail this guy and make us all look good.  but you better watch your ass.  if you screw up, i can promise you, you're goin' down.
i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
but that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
what makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
that's right.  i'm not like you. i'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... there's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and i'm gonna get him.  because it's my job. and if you don't get that...
what the fuck am i gonna protect that freak for?  he was dino's boy, not mine.  he shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  nobody knows.
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
this is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. didn't you say you'd seen him, wade?
out of this fucking job. this job sucks. working outside in the winter sucks.
his son-in-law damn near killed me.
the hell she isn't. lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day i met her. i'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. i've been thinking about it a lot. it's like she owns jill or something. nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. and i pay her.
doing your fucking job. i know. i watch television too.
cb. little while ago. one of the boys on the way in picked up jack on the cb calling for state troopers. i figured you'd know what really happened. the fucking guy kill himself? this twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
where the christ you going? you sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! i need... give me the goddamn keys! i need to get me to town!
shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
fuck off, you stupid asshole.
i hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
i hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  so it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
you know, burke, i don't know which species is worse.  you don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
i think he's a jew.
queen elizabeth is a man! prince charles is a faggot! winston churchill was full of shit!
parker, tell me what's going on so i can return as quickly as possible to boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
listen, you're dating luis, he's in arizona. you're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. what could you possibly be up to tonight?
i'm fucking serious. it's fucking over. us. this is no joke. i don't think we should see each other anymore.
is that all you ever have to contribute, van patten? "what about fucking dinner?"
wait. stop. you don't seem to understand. you're not really comprehending any of this. i killed him. i did it, carnes. i'm patrick bateman. i chopped owen's fucking head off. i tortured dozens of girls. the whole message i left on your machine was true.
i guess you're right...  that is, if the faggot in the next stall thinks it's okay!
you reek. you reek of...shit. do you know that?  goddammit, al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. al...i'm sorry.
didn't you visit the campus?
oh we're not going to the campus.
so -- how far are we from the campus?
i was about to throw in the towel.
your whores never showed up.
-- what the fuck were you thinking, huh? burning people? you're a fireman.
goddamn it, stephen, lay off!  you stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? you ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? why you're gonna be stuck a lt. for life?
had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. is that what happened? is it, stephen?
i know you cold, brian. the scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. but you see, in this job there's no place to hide. isn't like selling log cabins. you have a bad day here -- someone dies. and that's not fucking good enough. want another beer?
could you believe that fire? man! first day! there i was, adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! i love it here -- no surround and drown for this company. fighting 17th! goddamn stephen's amazing. you see how he took that fire by the balls? i'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
i hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? he kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 g to bring in some guys who raped a nun. what a sick fuck. man...
the church is a fucking racket. i know how they operate. i've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. my aunt lu says i was crying all the way through. yeah, i know their game inside out. now i'm free of it and i'm gonna stay that way.
yeah? at least she's alive! i see people get killed every day! worse yet, tortured first and then killed! the nuns got off easy. jeez. cigarette burns. everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. i'll show you cigarette burns!
who said anything about the fucking street. i've got more connects than you have, lieutenant...
i've been dodging bullets since i was fourteen. no one can kill me. i'm fucking blessed. i'm fucking catholic.
you're a fucking joke, you know that?  he's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. and i've been waiting here since -- forget it. listen up. you're gonna get us both fucking killed. you know that!
we know.  we know.  yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  not this injustice. nah, no way.  dem' two real coons iz ill.
let's go niggers!
let's go niggers.
alright.  here we go.  let's go niggers!  let's go niggers!
i'm gonna start a chant and i want y'all to follow me.  let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
if you think i'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  you got your ways to affect change, i have mine.  and i would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
there is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
don't you people get it?  we're in the 21st century.  slavery was over four hundred years ago.  all that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  let's all grow up.
to hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  it's un-american.  i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
i strongly feel that a negro should direct this.  this kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. one misstep and we're doing "amos and andy."  only a negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
do we have characters?  how about honeycutt, snowflake, rastus, nigger, jim, sambo, jungle bunny, and how could we forget aunt jemima.
mantan is an uneducated negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - mantan and sleep 'n eat.  the dusky duo.
mantan and sleep 'n eat.  two real coons.  i know we're way out there but it's satire.
what is it you want from me?  some plantation follies?  some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  you want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
that's exactly what i think.  i want you to create something that people want to see.  let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and i'm including 35 million african-americans.  you know and i know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  this is a golden opportunity now.  these idiots have to be led to the water.
i'm an oreo, a sell out?  because i don't aspire to do homeboys from out of space, secret diary of desmond pfeiffer, a pj's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  i'm a tom?  i'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? is that what you think?
you got your head stuck up your ass with your harvard education and your pretentious ways.  brother man, i'm blacker than you.  i'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
delacroix, wake up, brother man. the reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and i mean nobody - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
the material you've been creating is too white bread.  white people with black faces.  the huxtable's, cosby, revolutionary.  but that's dead.  we can't go down that road again.
nigger.  nigger.  nigger.  nigger.
c.p. time is colored people's time. the stereotypical belief that negroes are always late.  that negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
in life?  i'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. haven't i always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  the question is what are you gonna do, peerless?
the jolly nigger bank.
dunwitty wants a coon show.  and that's what i'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  hence i'll prove my point.
well before there was black or african american, there were negroes.  i'm a negro.
i don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  mantan - the new millennium minstrel show is universal.  it's not just for negroes in compton or 125th in harlem.  this is america.  our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  i'm not gonna box myself in. this show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
no if you go with the flow, tavis. that's what a lot of negroes don't understand.  protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  if people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  or better yet write your own show.  do it better.
go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  i'm sick and tired of niggers and i'm not gonna take it anymore!
cousins, i want all of you to go to your windows.  go to your windows and yell.  yell, i'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  i'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. i'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping god fearing, whore mongling professional athletes.  aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different ho's?  i know i am and so is sleep 'n eat.
shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, you just shut the fuck up.
you killed him you fucking faggot --
dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! he is not to be given food, water, or clothes! if he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
i hated west, childs hated west, everyone with a goddamn brain hated west but that doesn't mean we killed him!
oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. you know how much he hated west --
pike killed west, dunbar killed mueller, childs, and nunez.
you better watch it, faggot, i'm not sure you and childs didn't do him --
the faggot speaks.
"you're gonna die tonight, faggot". clear as day.
we all know what you did, pike. i don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
blame the nigger, then, huh? someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
what the fuck happened to you? one minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking christmas --
so forget what you've seen on sixty fucking minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
you should stop smoking. you're pregnant. you smoke like a fucking lab dog.
so. what's it like having to fuck men you hate?
this thing you got... i've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. i can see that.  but that nigger tehronne. thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. i mean, i can see a tree. but that piece of shit?
you think i'm ronnie's spy or somethin'? come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. you think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
you heard me, mother-fucker. i'll fuckin' kill..
if all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  rae. rae! i'm not fightin' with ya. i just know you got more in you than junk.  now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  you know how to boil water?
see, that girl is in my favor. you heard me, nigga? you fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
put yo'self in my shoes. say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. i been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
but that's so fuckin' stupid.  i'm sorry. didn't mean to curse.
ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? gill told me. told me how you and he... you and everybody...
it's stupid... it's so fucking stupid!
mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, i'm tellin' you. i'm just lookin' ahead.  anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's skittles. hey, that's what you need, girl. get you some cough medicine. what, you sick?
from the neighborhood?  shut the fuck up.  you like telephones? huh? you wanta go for a ride?
don't look at me, fuck. i shoot when i see the whites of the eyes.  you like me?
hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. i'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
you guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. that's some good shit.
meee! me! i'm the guy! i know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. i know where they fuckin' live. we could kill everyone!
oh, what the fuck? how do you guys decide who you're... i mean, who makes the cut? is there a raffle or something?
fuck it! i'm doing it. i deserve it. i've been working for those fat bastards since i was in high school and look at this place.
there are varying degrees of evil. we urge you lesser forms of filth  not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
a-fuckin'-men!
no, fuck you. this rope is bullshit. i'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. must weigh 30 pounds.
all right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
fan-fuckin-tastic!
fucking figures. look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? we got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. why did they kill the guys in the other two booths? why did he do the bartender? it would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  god, i hate cold crime scenes! i'm fucking leaving now. and do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
duffy. this look like a fucking post office to you? this guy came in here with intent. maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. the bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
these two fucking scenes are related. too many coincidences. same day? five hours apart? dead mobsters on both scenes. now, why did he kill the bartender?
and is there an american, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. this is our wet dream come true. you can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
now stay with me, boys. what did they do to make two such identical wounds? did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? no. two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! that's all she fuckin' wrote!
well, freud was right. so you think they came for the fag man, huh? and what do you base this upon?
these guys were pros. i think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
it tells us that he was the last to die. all these men  were carrying. they came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. didn't they, duffy?!  they sure as fuck did!
fine! fuck it! when we're done she can i.d. me. i don't care. just tryin' to be professional, but no...
shut up! shut the fuck up!
yeah. and uh, he's pissed off. he says, "why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? and he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
he's a nigger.
uh. okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! well... shit. okay, there's a white guy. he's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. but this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
check the fucking elevator. it's moving.
you're the faggot.
are you a fag?
i can't fucking believe this guy. an apology, bob?
i should kill you... if it's true you should die... i should kill you now!
i left a fingerprint! you fucking people.
no. but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. the balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
leave us alone you sick fuck!
eight weeks. we come from bulgaria. oh, things are very bad there, monsieur. a devil has the people by the throat. so, jan and i, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
and what if you track down these men and kill them? what if you murdered all of us? from every corner of europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. even nazis can't kill that fast.
you fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
can't kill another one.  can't.  can't kill my friends anymore.
what are you talking about? you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do.  we got it down cold, al. you don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
you know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. good suits, good food... the underworld of the underworld. a grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... i like that. i like the idea of that. these days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. it's all take, take, take. you can't just be fucking witty about it.
you were right. he's trying to fuck you. you want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
oh, you know... don't fuck this up. i'll kill you. i'll kill your family. i'll shoot your dog... all the usual. then he said good luck.
and the lies. gamblers are born liars.
cheers. happy new year. i really like you, jacko, you're so fucking straight.  hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
here's the dealio on eyes only.  he's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  so he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- i gotta go.
okay, shut the fuck up, lex! now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. i got...  twenty-five.
you're one to talk, lex. your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
well, i think you're the fucking anti-christ.
i am the pta! and i say that this filth is directly related to this vandalism.
then do it for peter. mrs. leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. he'd pop his nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, i don't know, got her back.
you hafta go home. there's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  the clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. pink cheeks, and...
sorry. i just thought she might not wanna meet her maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
don't fall for it. she lives two trailers down.
yeah, yeah, the jew.
...that filth is better left in the "sin cities."
english! english, you stupid little retard! we america now, tina!
that's a-no good.  you gotta insult somebody from another country.  look --  i come from one country.  you come from another country.  i say something you don't like.  you say something i don't like - and i'm insulted.
your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  without his country's financial aid --
kill! kill!
i must kill! kill!
we're being attacked! kill! kill! kill!
and if you have to kill somebody, kill them! don't stop to think about it.
you can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
fuck you, joel. faggot.
no, see, clem, i assume you fucked someone tonight. isn't that how you get people to like you?
a wino? jesus, are you from the fifties? a wino!  face it, joel. you're freaked out because i was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
oh christ i didn't kill anybody. it's just a fucking dent. you're like some old lady or something.
well it is pathetic. and fucking irresponsible. you could've killed somebody.
i don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. we like the same writers. this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to. and he's cute. it's fucked up. joel, you should come up to the charles with me sometime.
then if you are japanese, then why are you called the chink?
learned from the chink? oh my. ha ha. that's hard to say. we mostly.... uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
really? the chink, huh? i've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. what else have you learned from the chink?
did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? it's not original. it's something i picked up from the chink.
chink's the guy's name, for christ's sake.
if we ivy leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'chink.' next thing i know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
you bet your raggedy white ass i am.
freak, schmeek. most of us are freaks in one way or another. try being born a male russian countess into a white middle class baptist family in mississippi and you'll see what i mean.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." the crew is dead, dr. weir. this ship killed them. and now it's killing us.
your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. it may have killed one of my men.  no one goes near that thing.
we're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. in three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. we are fucking dead.
not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
my brother is going to kill us. he's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. he's gonna kill us.
ridiculous! just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and i picked you up. you never saw me before. shit, this town is full of white cadillac convertibles. i plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. you ready?
what? fuck telegrams. i'm in trouble. you worthless bastard. i'll cripple your ass for this! all that shit in the car is yours! you understand that? when i finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
dogs fucked the pope, no fault of mine. watch out!... why money? my name is brinks i was born... born?
this is the place. they'll never fuck with us here.
i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! it won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
you whore!
turn up the fucking music! my heart feels like an alligator! volume! clarity! bass! we must have bass! what's wrong with us? are you goddamn old ladies?
two lines! two fucking lines! 'my wife returns from europe tomorrow. i can't see you any more.' just like that!
i've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but i'll be back around ten. if you're still up, we can talk, okay?
now, you listen to me. you ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! nobody cares what you think, i'm running this show, i make the decisions.
they're gonna kill us. they get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
you all are gonna fuckin' die! i'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
he's smilin' at us. but behind his smile, he's sayin', "fuck you jack." i hear that loud and clear.
if he touches her, i'll kill him. i don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
come on, gimme some more details. how'd it happen? some fuckin' drunk kill her?
just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  you two, simon says sit the fuck down!
what's the story with you two? you a couple of fags?
it's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. for twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. and then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
yeah, like a mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
yep. we're heading for the rendezvous right now. we get there, we pound booze till carlos shows up, he escorts us to el ray. and then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. how ya like them apples?
fuck those spic pigs! you called me a fuckin' nut, and where i come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
this is not me! i am a professional fucking thief. i steal money. you try to stop me, god help you. but i don't kill people i don't have to, and i don't rape women. what you doin' ain't how it's done. do you understand?
richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. we showed our ass in texas. we killed texas fuckin' rangers. they ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. the el paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
look, fuck the border. let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
i gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. longer we fuck around el paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
these guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from tijuana. they don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  you wanna stay in el ray? you give them thirty percent of your loot. it's scripture. so it is written, so shall it be done. you want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
how 'bout you?  you are safer in here with us than wandering around a mexican border town all night long. just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  from this point forward, i want all press matters coordinated via my office. i'll be god-damned if i'm gonna watch hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. him or the president.  this my shade?  "midnight mahogany"? 'cuz i'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like ronald reagan here.
fuck.  basher-basher, this is ground crew six requesting emergency extraction. stand by for a prc fix...
we're fucked.
congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
after visiting congress i know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
negroes?  washington has black men in his army?  are they good fighters?  what's that red ribbon on his arm, colonel?
our 'kind'?  what is that supposed to mean?  these men are all i have left and they stay because they will fight!  they desire it!  they seek it!  of course virginia is terrified!  for my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! should i tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  it is impossible for me to imagine that negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! if we win this war they will own this country too!
oh, indeed?  you know very well people are frightened of arming the negroes!  they beg you to consider the future.  what good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
just because they are born?
hell, why not just shoot her? why not shoot everybody. fuckin' shoot me. shoot the fuckin' president?
i can't believe the way you guys do business out here. i can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
'cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. his ass belongs to me.
you're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. let's just get to where you're at, okay? you blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. why not?
these guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. so they come in on another deal - this was back a few months ago when i was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. the characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer -
they don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. that annoys them. so your dear friend dick allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. i happen to be in vegas on another matter, and dick asks me as a favor would i look you up. i follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress karen flores, was in grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
you cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
what's momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, i don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. and you already got a job.
i say fuck the motherfucker. we're a professional salvage crew going about our business. what's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  you can do what you want, greer. but neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
i can't imagine spending money on towels.
i'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  aren't these the greatest towels?
he should totally just kill himself... hey, here's one  ...oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
tsk! you jews are so clever with money...
at least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
yeah, well, you're not the only one. everybody i know has totally fucked up problems... it seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
what have they done besides kill starling?  how many have they killed?
"vigo the carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
no, we're moving you off campus.  the board of regents has decided to terminate your grant.  you are to vacate these premises immediately.
i trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
the wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
ray, as your friend i have to tell you i think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  you've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the five boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  and what have you seen?
underdog!  how can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  i'm the emperor why can't i kill him?  he could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
you seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  narcissus, the republic is dead.  you think those senators could govern?  for the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of imperial asses!
oh, shit.  take your time!  don't get suckered!  this man is a murderer!  in his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  please, just take the fall!
you hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. it's for working scams against insurance companies.
linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
i don't know.  i hope he never hunts.  i hope he never kills another human being.
so he can kill you.  you hate your own life that much.  you beg for a hero to kill you.
cook, by god!  cook!  you're the nigger now.
i dunno.  marry the first whore who's nice to me, i guess.  get a job in a motorcycle shop.  so long, you guys.
a fairy--a queer.  everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
shit! you just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. i knew this was a scam. i shouldn'ta come.
if he has anything to say about it, yeah. i've been asking a lot of questions and i don't like the answers i'm getting. he's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
who? the whore? no. she's just a victim. a dime a dozen.
you know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. you can buy child whores, slaves. you can have people raped, killed...  one of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named ratan. he usually isn't in this country.  how'd you hear about him?
nah. they don't care about some faggot hustler. they're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. like i am.
"one falls, two shall arise." so: you pop one, two come out. you kill two, you get four. you kill four, you're in trouble. we have to nail 'em all at once. and the eggs.
there's a towel in the bathroom.
you'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next friday night.
of course i'm not coming.  do i look like i'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  where is it?  the fucking bucktown pub?  ha!
shut the fuck up, barry.
un-fucking-believable.  dick's out on a hot date, rob's boning marie lasalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
how the fuck am i supposed to know that?  you might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
it's not my car, now is it?  it's laura's car, and thus laura has it. so it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. wow.  fucking great.
that's fucking great, barry.  we can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  fantastic, barry!
okay, okay -- "leader of the pack." the guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "dead man's curve," jan and dean...
i'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  what is his fucking name, ian or ray?  what do you call him?
you kind of have to start with elvis costello, but where? "motel matches?" "i want you?" "i hope you're happy now?" "green shirt?" his records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "where did you sleep last night," sure, but by robert johnson or by nirvana?  maybe a liz phair track.  there are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. some devil's advocate stuff.  the silver jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  but i think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  ah.  dylan. bob fucking dylan.  now bob dylan would --the phone rings.  he pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
i know i can't speak now because laura's father died, and i just have to take it because otherwise i'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  well, i'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, i'm really sorry jo.  but you know, liz... i can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  and maybe you think i should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
exactly!  fucking ex-actly!
he's in jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  a friend of my daughter's. he had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and i told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever i go, minus a ten percent commission. which reminds me.  can you make sure you give me a five?  i want to frame it and put it on the wall.
offered the pope one of his whores.
i'll never forget the look on that papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over neuvich.
please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
i'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
take that, you fucking slut!  fucking redneck whore!
oh, wonderful.  fucking psycho.
you know... a couple of queers.
really fucking awesome.
then the devil says, "are you gay?" guy says, "fuck no"... devil says, "well then, i guess you're gonna hate thursdays."
fuck yeah, she is. i'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the president or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
yeah, she said we looked queer.
i'm with denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
you're fucked up, lila.  why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? figure it out for chrissake.
no maid service! for god's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
that's funny because, you know, i just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. he called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
ergo if i can teach table manners to mice, i can teach them to humans. if i can teach table manners to humans, i can save the world.
eddie, you're a born loser.
you bet he knows how.  you think that's a talent too, huh? knowin' how to drink whisky? you think minnesota fats was born knowin' how to drink?
you're, uh, you're minnesota fats, aren't you? you know, uh, they say minnesota fats is the best in the country out where i come from.
will you keep feeding me?  how long can you live like that?  until it kills you?  until i kill you? without your blood i'll go back.
you are the human.  the hunter.  the thing that comes in the day and kills --
you're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
they're busy covering their asses. they're not the type of people we need."
what street?! we're walking down queer street. we coming to dopey drive. we're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
you better take a good look! because i'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at brown & williamson as we fucking speak?
get me to new orleans this afternoon. i'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
i'm staying right here. doing my job. fighting to get my show on the air. you don't like it? hey, i'll tell you what... fire my ass...
no, i'm questioning your hearing! you hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." i hear... "potential brown & williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of cbs to westinghouse." i hear... "shut the segment down. cut wigand loose. obey orders. and fuck off...!" that's what i hear.
jeff! wake the fuck up! everybody is on the line here. if they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. do you understand? everything you say!
and i've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before the wall street journal runs.  i am trying to protect you, man!
shut up. i was a lawyer. just like you. and my clients? whores just like you.
well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
yes. i know. it's exactly how i felt when i realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
but then -- i guess -- something inside me died when i realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
that's it. dyke's auto camp.
al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  goddamn, sam!  if we don't start reading between the lines here! y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the cia does. we're through the looking glass. here white is black and black is white.
i don't know how they got to me. maybe cause i repped him here.  the feebees run background checks.  on my mama's breasts, man, that's all i got.  there wasn't no conspiracy, jim.  if there were, why the hell didn't bobby kennedy prosecute it as attorney general, he was his brother for chrissake.  how the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, i don't know.  it was oswald.  he was a nut job.  faggot, y'know, hated this country.
hell, no!  i told this bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. i deal with muni court, i'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
you knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  he had command of the king's english.
swishes.  they swish, y'know.  young fags, you know.  they'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and i'd say, hey man, i ain't rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  these cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
get home my ass.  we're going to the office, have another drink.  i want some company tonight.
a bullshit president!  i don't see any weeping for all the thousands of cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the bay of pigs. where are all the tears for the russians and hungarians and chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by kennedy's communist buddies - all these damned peace treaties! i'm telling ya jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  they get together with the jews and the catholics and elect an irish bleeding heart.
i told your uncle i never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  you too, bill, even if you're family.  he's a big shot businessman.  i seen him on the tv news a lot with all the other big shots.  a fag, you know.  goes by another name down here.
fuck, yes.  hell, i'm already in jail.  i got no reason to lie to you.  i ain't no nigger.
they're agency, too.  don't you get it?  cia and mafia together.  trying to whack out the beard.  mutual interests.  they been doing it for years.  there's more to this than you dream.  fbi fucking hates the cia.  navy intelligence got something to do with it too.  check out "alan pope" in miami.  jack youngblood. bill harvey.  colonel roselli.  the shooter, i hear, was a dallas cop - the bagman at ruby's club.  i heard he shot his own partner.  got that? check out the rich fucks in dallas. h.l. hunt.  he's dirty.  that's all i know.  but the agency always runs the show.  check out something called "mongoose"  operation mongoose. government, pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out southeast asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
that cocksuckin' faggot!  he's got me by the balls.
somebody planted that fucking story! and somebody tipped off the press i'm one of garrison's fucking suspects.  i can't go home. i'm out on the street.  the maggots are everywhere!  do you know what you've done to me?  it's all over the national news now.  you know what you've done to me?
they'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... they're untouchable, man...  i'm so fucking exhausted i can't see straight.
oh man, why don't you stop.  this is too fuckin' big for you!  who did kennedy?  it's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  don't you get it yet?  i can't be talking like this.  they're gonna kill me. i'm gonna die!  i don't know what happened.  all i wanted in the world was to be a catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient latin manuscripts, pray, serve god.  but i had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  they defrocked me.  and then i started to lose everything.
black, black - just give it to me.  shit.  i'm so exhausted.  my neck is killing me.  i've got cancer.  had it for years.  i been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
you wanna know why?  'cause that mother fucker kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  nixon was gonna be one of the great presidents 'til kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause kennedy promised 'em too damned much. revolution comin'.  fascism's coming back.  i tell ya this - the day that communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  i jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  people should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'cause he was a communist.  put me on the stand, go ahead, i'll tell the same goddamn story, i'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
there was rose cheramie.  a whore. two cubans threw her out of a car on the way to dallas.
sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  i saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "love child."  it's fuckin' outa control.  values've gone to hell, jim... course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat johnson in the white house.
he'll never make it.  if he wins, they'll kill him.  he wants to avenge his brother.  he'll stop that war. no, they'll kill him before they let him become president.
answer the question, nigga. do you think i wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? yes or no?
what the fuck i tell you. you don't hafta shoot nobody. just hold the gun. they'll get the idea.
look, i hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then bam -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. but i'm afraid i gotta be that kinda nigga.
oh, you're both? in 1985 you were flying for twa and got busted for carrying drugs. you were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. he did time and you got off. but that ended your career with the big airlines. cut to thirteen years later. you're forty-four years of age. you're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit mexican airline that there is. where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. that ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. and to top it off, you're going to jail. now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. but this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. but in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. now, wasn't this money given to you by an american living in mexico by the name of cedric walker?
he always just picked it up at my place. but with a.t.f. involved, i want to stage it. you know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. then it's up to ray nicolet, the a.t.f. guy to follow the shopping bag.
short of wearing a wire, i'll do everything i can to help you throw his ass in jail. and in exchange for my help, i need permission to leave the country and immunity.
i ain't gonna send no roc whore. the woman's cool, i promise.
look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. you send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
i bet you come here on a saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
i'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. they turn black against black, that's how they do.
you thought right... now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
if there were nothin in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and a.t.f. got it. but, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
he put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  and if you know beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. and if you know that, you know beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the federal government everything they want to know about my ass. now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. and you best believe it ain't gonna be me. you know what i'm sayin'? you gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. i got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in cabo san lucas. me and mr. walker make us one more delivery, i'm gonna have me over a million. you think i'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? shit, you better think again. 'fore i let this deal get fucked up, i'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  understand what i'm sayin'?
well, bully for that nigga. you say she wants to give me the money, huh?
things happen? what the fuck are you talking about? they did something to us, frank. we have to expose this.
okay, not you rod. but the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. they're tryin' to kill us. fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
you wanna know? turn on the t.v. watch the fucking news!
what's my status?! i've lost three men and your worthless fuck! after i kill this asshole i'm coming your yllo!
brodski i'll talk slow so you can understand me. she's thawing. if we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
hey teach! this rock's starting to freeze! get your ass back hre!
yo, teach, what the fuck?
i'm going to hire quint to kill the fish. i want to see that shark dead.
i'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! there are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
there's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. it happened like this before, in 1916, when a great white killed five swimmers at jones beach, in long island.
real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to mr. whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. he was born with what he does best. eat. he's a swimming appetite. 'course he might eat this stuff, but then i've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  next time, ask me.
plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. you actually look at my face. and every time i look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
i'm not mad. i'm in a fucking great mood. despite the fact that i'm trapped in a fat suit i can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
well, i was born to be a mother. some of us are.
shit, it ain't hard to play pool. i can teach you everything ya need ta know.
i'm scared. a week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. this afternoon you're out there wielding it around like clyde fucking barrow, for christ's sake! what's with you?
so. these people live on the same streets. it's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. the regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
i want to knock her guard down. i mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
come on nigga. sup, sup then? stop faking moves.
and sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
i hate sucking dick!
everywhere. fuckin' flophouse. we're still short on the rent. if you want, you and casper can move in. you guys can share the bathtub.
everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
i killed him when he was born.  this place is my punishment.
i expect some kind of loyalty here. just because i fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
want to kill yourself? are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
what could i do?  he's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. i'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. happens every day. at least to women like me.
cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby rufus. i got jackcrap.
oh, he is so over on this campus.
just because i'm not a vanderbilt, all of a sudden i'm white trash? i grew up in bel air, warner! across the street from aaron spelling! i think most people would agree that's way better than a vanderbilt --
elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
hand me a towel.  hand me a towel.
hand me a towel.  i'm getting out.
well, congratulations!  you fucking pulled it off!
queer.
nigger.
no, nigger.
they ain't men, mae rose. they're convicts. and nigger convicts to boot. can you say nigger?
they're called pilots! i'm serious, ray. i'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
man, you really bummed me out. that's a terrible story.  nigger, you crying?
i'm afraid i'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
goddamn it, wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
goldmouth? they say he was born out back behind the shithouse. that's what they say.
jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  the lifeclocks made me kill francis. they make people die or be killed every day. if i didn't try and destroy that... i couldn't live here or anywhere. do you understand?
you want to go back to kill, is that it?! now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill sandmen!!! killing's all you ever...!!!
six fuckin' car lengths... that's about a hundred and six fuckin' feet, mister! you were following ten feet behind me... if i'd had to stop suddenly, you would have hit me. i want you to get a driver's manual, and i want you to study that motherfucker... and i want you to obey the god damn rules. fifty fuckin' thousand people were killed on the road last year.  cause of fuckin' assholes like you. tell me you're gonna get a manual.
you've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
i know, but we're on a college campus...
that's why you have doors, mr. president.  keys, however, are to lock the doors.  and locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  why? fear.  you humans are afraid.  so you set up boundaries.  borders. your car.  your home.  your country.  all the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  well i am here to let that enemy go.  because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  it's the border to the universe.  and unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  it was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  until now.  because i have been sent here to open the door.  to present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
how did i not see this?  agatha, who killed you mother?  who killed anne lively?
yeah 'women.' if i was a fag i could get laid in a subway.
what? you don't think horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
bullshit. these are classy customers. you can't show up all fucked up with a fila running suit on.
who the fuck do you think you're talking to? this ain't a fucking democracy. you want out?
bobby, i love jessica like she's my own daughter. i would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in beverly hills and wants i should buy him an implant. your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
they're fucking yeshiva buchas. you didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. you knocked out a guys teeth.
never won a race. but it got me in with the trainer. we'd have a thing, i don't remember, some fucking thing. the jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. people get greedy. first they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. the odds would drop, i mean you could watch the goddamn board. it looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
i didn't tell him shit. he worries too much. i love that old jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. we started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
'dis?' 'dis?' you're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your real world sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. you're nothing. you're wallpaper. you're not here to make fucking friends. asking a motherfucker where he lives. and who the fuck told you 'red dragon'?.
think about it: you knocked out that jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. maybe lost his whole line of clientele? he knows you're fucking up jess' dancing, and i got a feeling he knows i stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. he can't kill us in la cause that leads to too many questions. so he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? he can make us disappear out here real nice...
don't fuck around. you're gonna get us all killed.
they only cover one fifty in incidentals. you've been ordering fucking... motherfucker...
look, man, i never met ruiz, okay? i don't know what the fuck i'm picking up, what the fuck i'm dropping off, who the fuck i'm meeting. all i know is maxie's still pissed at me cause i sold his fucking van.
some mexican? how much could he weigh? a buck fifty, tops? i'd kick his fucking ass.
show me. show me where it says screech on the fucking list.
again with the fucking china club! what do i look like a fucking persian to you?
the welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. but you motherfuckers, he just laughs. all beat up in your babaloo suit like fruitpie the magician.
nigger, please. don't even order that artichoke shit. west side guineas. forget the drinks, leo. we gotta roll. what do i owe you?
will you tell peter jennings to shut up and fucking listen. the shit's as routine as you get. i coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but maxie likes to do it all his way. safe. i coulda dropped the bag alone. it's only two hundred g's. but he sent you all. so i can either send you home and tell maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
no. elijah muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." he teaches us that the white man is the devil. all white men.
i knew you'd hear me. the white man is the devil. all white men are devils.
i read. i study. because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. respect his body and his mind. quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
i thought you was smart. but you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. like a monkey. and the white man sees you and he laughs. he laughs because he knows you ain't white.
like what? looking like me? like a nigger?! why don't you want to look like what you are? what makes you ashamed of being black?
mr. x, i was out there tonight. i saw what you did. i want to be a muslim. i ain't never seen a negro stand up to the police like that.
stop calling us. leave us alone. leave us alone. i'll kill you. i'll kill you.
we had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
well, i have this to say. do you know what a negro with a b.a., an m.a. and a ph.d. is called -- by the white man? i'll tell you. he's called a nigger.
for the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "do you hate me!" the white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
mr. x is a demagogue. he has no place to go, so he exaggerates. he's a disservice to every good law-abiding negro in the country. can i ask you a question?
...that isn't a whore?
head nigger in charge?
i'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
i didn't know then that i was a nigger.
japanese are here in a big way. cheap labor. factory space. but they feel a lot safer living over the border in el paso. i ferry 'em back and forth. they think i'm john-fucking- wayne.
an autosequestra. kalfus arranged for pinta to be taken to a safehouse. i'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching tv. it didn't work out that way. everything got fucked up when i killed the cops and tazinari saw an opportunity.
don't forget your towel.
i'm ugly... i'm ugly! i'm ugly!
blue suit, gray suit, i'm still a fat man. a fat ugly man.
must be the famous curb service whore   house. you in the market duke?
okay, major, honey.  i'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. i'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine regular army clown. and that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  see you around the campus.
leave town? they're going to know me in fucking des moines now!...  they got over ten million in jewels in that place. that's freedom, man. i could go anywhere i want.
i hate fucking springfield.
whoa!... the government. they control everybody's mind. you're too fucking stupid to know that?
he's gonna kill her no matter what. if i take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
thou shall not kill... you've killed, right?
and i ain't no nigger either!
can't we get a couple whores over?
sure, frankie. fuck me. fuck meyer. fuck arnold rothstein who's made us all rich. all so you can be an fuckin' honorary sicilian!
how much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
the fat man's scared. scared of us, and scared without us. same with maranzano. we gotta get their minds back on each other. this fuckin' peace is killin' us.
italians, jews, irish. one big party. course, some guys don't get along.
a mother-fuckin' peace conference.
tell it to the calabrian. tell it to the jews.
share with them as you wish. do business with them on your own. but no filthy jew will ever be a brother to me.
and the jews?
those fucks can't leave each other alone. maranzano and masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
kill them! kill them!
a jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
that a jew compliment?
wait a minute. stu miley, right? boys and girls ...mr. stu miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> this is an <u>honor</u>. we see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. you da <u>shits</u>!!
i've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. somebody had better start paying attention, or i'm gonna - i'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
the sidekicks' union! me, tonto, and robin the boy wonder. you top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!
no gentleman caller, doc.  not that i care. i've had it with men. they're so fascinated by their own crap. took me four years to get the last one out. almost turned me into a dyke... these days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. now that feels good. and you don't have to do all that... listening.
i don't know if i can quit. we're gonna try it together, like, you know, aa or something. and i made him give up his .22. no more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. what do you think, joseph?
yes, i'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
shut up.  i been trying to tell yo' ass that... day-day is my cousin.  they're right there in the back.
this my baby.  i feel like a new nigga in this car.  i get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than i ever did on the bus.
nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
no, i'mma go on to work.  i don't wanna hear elroy's mouth.  now listen to me, craig.  it's gonna be different living over here.  don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  understand?
that nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  that's why moving wit'cha uncle elroy and cousin day-day is the best thing for you right now.
i kill her - and you kill me.
ain't seen you in a coon's age, johnny.
just look at you! dust and filth from top to toe!
guys can have nightmares too, y'know. you ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
that's just it. it makes people feel queer. i dont' want you to get in any trouble.
never.  i never said that about jews!
we are covering up!  for some petty, stupid shit.  there are things i can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. but when i say them nobody believes me anyway ...
no, you're not!  you're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the fifth amendment.  i don't give a shit.  they can't force the president's people to testify.
no, no.  he's our only "star" right now.  he'd go crying straight to the press.  he'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  get someone from our staff on his ass. tap his phones.  i want to know everyone he talks to.
not like the others -- dean, mccord, the rest ... we never got our side of the story out, al.  people've forgotten.  i mean: "fuck you, mr. president, fuck you tricia, fuck you julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  the tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, black panthers -- we fixed it, al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  they lionize that traitor, ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's nixon.  ... they've always hated nixon.
... there can be no whitewash at the white house ... two wrongs do not make a right.  i love america.  god bless america and god bless each and every one of you.
why would they?!  who the hell's sulzberger anyway?  their parents are gold traders from eastern europe. they buy things.  they come to jew york city and they buy up things.  one of the things they buy is the new york times.  and you know what?  be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average american.
you're talking too much about black africa, henry.  it's killing us with the rednecks.
the jews aren't the middle, henry. they're the far left.
she understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  the cia, the mafia, the wall street bastards ...
because ... because dick helms knows too much ... if anyone in this country knows more than i do, it's hoover and helms!  you don't fuck with dick helms!  period.
he wouldn't do the makeup.  said it was for queers.
then find something.  and i want these leaks stopped.  jack fucking anderson, the new york times, the state department -- i want to know who's talking to them.
... and now i have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. i think, mr. president, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
it looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the communists.  "detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
resent it all you want, henry, but you're in it with the rest of us. cambodia, ellsberg, the wiretaps you put in.  the president wants you to know you can't just click your heels and head back to harvard yard.  it's your ass too, henry, and it's in the wind twisting with everyone else's.
jews and negros don't win elections, henry.  better to hang them around the democrats' necks.
you'll pick up the middle on this one - the jews and negros.
this will get me a second term.  damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. there's no history.  i, nixon, was born to do this.
he's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  he sees a shrink in l.a.  he's all fucked up. now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... if he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  he must be stopped at all costs.
mr. president, we are in a revolutionary situation.  we are under siege -- black panthers, weathermen the state department under rogers is leaking like a sieve.  and now this insignificant little shit ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
the jewboy's a harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
when they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
and this?!  good lord, have you lost your mind?  nixon can't say this. "niggers"!
what i know about this country, i ... i could rip it apart.  if they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  but i will never resign this office.  where the fuck am i?
they sell tickets to an impeachment. like a fucking circus ... okay, so they impeach me.  then it's a question of mathematics.  how many votes do we have in the senate?
who the fuck are they?  bob, are you working on revoking the posts's television license?  good.
congratulations, dick.
you've been drinking.  what the hell are you saying?  jesus, you sound like them now! ...  i've gotta keep fighting, buddy, for the country.  these people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots!  they don't have the long-term vision anymore.  they just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down.  oh, god, this country's in deep trouble, buddy ... and i have to see this through.  mother would've wanted no less of me ... i'm sorry, buddy.
you're ruining us.  if we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  this isn't political, dick.  this is our life.
did you go up to his trailer?
i've got a pretty good idea. you're here to kill me, so kill me. you want me to be afraid, but i'm not. i don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
and i don't need sue ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
fuck the details, they're always to blame... look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. i see it at my company all day long! so i'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  one of us should.
i didn't think so. so, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
it's a small town, man. i never should have left omaha. people here think small. they act small. they're a bunch of dumb fucks.
we could do that. i could be on my way to florida, and you could go to thailand and fuck your brains out.
do i deserve this? in the twilight of my career, do i deserve this? i don't think so! i've always tried to do what's right. i never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. i'm a professional!  and where the fuck am i? i'm in purgatory!
there it is again. that lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. that "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  they don't owe us shit, wesley! when you finish the job, you get paid!! we haven't finished the goddamn job!!
betty would never dress like that. she's not some trailer park slut!
i can eat because i know we didn't kidnap that woman. i can eat because they aren't looking for us. and i can eat 'cause i'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. she's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
well, no one ever spit in my face before. especially some cracker fuck.
shut up! shut the fuck up, both of you, before i kill you!
well if that is pete i am ashamed of him.  the way i see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a babylon.  these things-
fuck the record. now you listen to me and do exactly what i tell you.  start back ten yards and take off from here. not here... or there... but right here!  no excuses, seeger! you are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! you want jets? then do it, goddamnit!
just trying to have fun. that fucking prison is really starting to get to me. c'mon, seeger. gimme a push.  fuck you guys! i'll do it myself!
only two things come out of oklahoma, steers and queers. which one are you, boy? i don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? is that why you called me a 'ewe'? are you a queer?
however you got it figured, i didn't kill sid and lynette didn't kill him! he killed himself!
want me to get a towel?
i don't know who you think you're talking to! i ain't some whore you brought here! i've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
you're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  you don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  huh?  we're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  the worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
yes.  yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  you fuck.  now how are you gonna get us into that room?
drugs judge, they're gonna flood west oakland with dope. jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. and while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every panther they can find.
yeah... i'm fucked up. you're fucked up. government's fucked up. whole country's fucked up. you got no idea what's going on here. this is bigger than you and me. we're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. the panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
shut up. just shut the fuck up.
who fucking cares? you cops killed cy. and before you bastards kill anyone else, i'll give you your fucking set up. that make you happy??!!
i ain't gonna tell you no more. no pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. you're killing your own people asshole.
well... like they say, there's a panther born every minute in the ghetto. uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the black community. it's their power base...
not good enough rodgers. not good enough at all. black terrorists on the floor of a state capitol. i will not say this again, these negro commies are to be stopped and now. you tear them down. either from the outside or the inside.
the white power structure wants us to act like savages.  but we're a different kind of animal altogether. we're panthers. and the black panther party for self defense is very painfully aware that america has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. so we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! and effect revolution. we revolve the power into the hands of the people. where it belongs.  power to the people baby...
you fit the profile, brother. you look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
yeah i know. you're smart judge. you ain't no bourgeois nigger like those paper panthers across the bay. i need every good man to help us with the security on betty shabazz, particularly soldiers. you do solid on that i might have something else for you, something real important.
you know, you're lucky to be back. most niggers die on the front lines. seems like that's what they're there for.
i don't know, honey. different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. some believe in heaven or hell. some think we're born again as little children--
mr. gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and cotton.  i want every inch of the pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
my name is smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. i'm white, male and over twenty-one. i've never been in jail - that is, not often. and i prefer scotch to bourbon. i hate carrots, i hate peas, i like black coffee and i hate garters. i make seventy-five bucks a week and i've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - i don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
oh my. you mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
no. you baked them for whitey.
oh, no ... you baked those for whitey.
like when margaret henderson makes her cookies for whitey.  ... those aren't your cookies bud.
you just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." i'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
there is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
i know. i know. i know. i just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. fuck.
you fuck off. you fuck off and die i will hurt you for hurting her. you hurt her.
calm down shut the fuck up and calm down shut shut shut up shut up --
for fuck's sake, who else would it be? the witching hour's arrived you've alerted the others, yes?
whores and pederasts? you're better off without them.
fuck 'em! they're half-wits and pinheads. let 'em die on the streets, as nature intended.
i write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! the whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
that ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
for fuck's sake, woman! bonbons? i'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what i truly need -- what i truly require -- are a few quill pens? perhaps a pot of ink?
me, i'm proud to be a jew, i got no problem. you don't like it, fuck you. but with these guys it's like a dirty word. all they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good american and a jew. so sam goldfish becomes sam goldwyn and david selznick becomes david 0. selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's irish for fuck's sake--
this is just the first shot. maestro. sooner or later she's gonna use the word. and all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the jews.
so they're jews. . .
who owns this town? who runs every goddamn studio? the tribe, baby. these fuckers hear the word "jew" and they start sweating. like ester williams' pool they start sweating.
jews. she's talking about jews.
howard hughes, he would just kill us. hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
i don't wanna write about no spic.
i'm not fucking with hughes. that shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. just like jean harlow
this isn' t some kinda fucking game! you know how many people rko employs?! you know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
who the fuck are you trying to kid? you are that soulless monster.
orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
you're very smart, joey, very smart. nobody gives me a straight answer around here. you're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. did you fuck vickie?
i meant, kill everybody. you or me or anybody. you're a big shot. kill, kill... g'head.
so, go ahead. kill everybody. kill salvy, kill vickie, kill tommy como, kill me while you're at it. what do i care? you're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
this janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. knockout this fuckin' kid! i'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. listen to me: i'm telling you. you been killin' yourself for three years. there's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. this janiro's up-and- coming. he don't know. fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! what are you worried about? your weight? look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. they'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. and if you beat this kid janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. all right?
harder.  take the towel off.
nothing is what i said! go on, kill me.  kill me.  i'm not afraid of you anymore. i don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. you're a sick animal.
you're killing him. you're killing him for nothing. stop it.
i'll say anything you want me to say. i fuckled salvy. i fucked tommy. i fucked your brother. i fucked everybody! what do you want to hear? i sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
you can't fit in here -- i can't fit in there. according to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
he'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  bury him all over the place.
if you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. if they think you're not you, they will kill you. don't you see? i know what you're doing, but it won't work!
you go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. you need six.  six is me.
i been driving rigs a long time, nick. four, five million miles of road. worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less i was driving fifteen hours a day. tell 'em i needed sleep, i needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
monster. if we're working together here, we gotta be working together. i can't walk in there looking like the lone fucking ranger with ten bucks to throw down. you don't want me getting noticed, right? not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
shut the fuck up. you play what your girlfriend plays. ashley's going in with you. you talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. you walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, i want to know the run of the place.
get in there and watch 'em. watch their every fuckin' move.
his lips went next. you ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
you got pug killed! you tried to get me killed! you just lost your get- outta-jail-free --
i been in iron mountain for two years, truck driver. i do one more crime, i'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. you want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? i want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
i told you i don't know anything about any fucking set up. i've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! i don't know anything! you can torture me if you want -
now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. it's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. it's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
you tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. look, vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. but don't try to fuck me. i don't think of you that way. i mean, i like you a lot -
well, whoever she was, elois looked like her. so one night i walk into the club, and no elois. now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was carlos. so i asked him "hey, carlos, where's lady e tonight?" well apparently lady e was married to this real piece of dog shit. i mean a real animal. and apparently he would so things to her.
there is no fuckin' set up!  look, this is the news. blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. white and pink come with me, 'cuz if joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
well, if this crook's a brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from wisconsin. and i'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed joe to a damned-if-i- know, that in milwaukee they got a sheet on this mr. white motherfucker's ass. i want you to go through the mugs of guys from old milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
you two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. we're there for those stones, period. since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. we're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. what if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
never ceases to amaze me. fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. fuckin' nigger gets doris day as a parole officer. but a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
fuck you, wrong. i'm right! what the fuck do you know about it anyway? you're still listening to jerry- fucking-vale.
cause you're a faggot, alright?
joe, if you kill that man, you die next. repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
for the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "toby... toby... toby... toby wong... toby wong... toby chung... fuckin' charlie chan." i got madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and toby jap i-don't-know-what, outta my left.
i found this old address book in a jacket i ain't worn in a coon's age. toby what? what the fuck was her last name?
that fucking bastard! that fucking sick fucking bastard!
he's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery.  what are you, a silent partner? fuckin' tell him.
you see what i been puttin' up with? as soon as i walk through the door i'm hit with this shit. i tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and mr. white whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "you motherfucker, i'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
that fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
fuck jail! i don't give a shit about jail. but i can't die. you don't have to take me in. just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. i'll take care of myself. i won't tell them anything. i swear to fucking god, i won't tell 'em anything. look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  i-won't-tell-them-anything. you'll be safe.
you're not gonna fucking die, all right?
look, i don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, i gotta see a doctor. i don't give a fuck about jail, i just don't wanna die.
i don't even know a jew who'd have the balls to say that. so let's get this straight. you never ever tip?
oh that's really easy for you to say, you're mr. white. you gotta cool-sounding name. so tell me, mr. white, if you think "mr. pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
okay, mr. expert. if this is such a truism, how come every nigger i know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  i don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and i'm the only one actin like a professional. you guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. you ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? they're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
fuck you, white! i didn't create this situation, i'm just dealin' with it. you're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. i'm actin like a professional. they get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. and you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. i didn't tell him my name. i didn't tell him where i was from. i didn't tell him what i knew better than to tell him. fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. you, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. so if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. that bullet in his belly is my fault. now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. and i'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
that kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that i saw him take. so don't be calling him a rat.
i think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! we're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. i came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. everybody panics. when things get tense, everybody panics. everybody. i don't care what your name is, you can't help it. it's human nature. but ya panic on the inside. ya panic in your head. ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. what you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
that was one of the most insane fucking things i've ever seen. why the fuck would joe hire somebody like that?
fuck you too, you whore!
listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
fuck you too, you rotten whore!!
oh, please. come on, john. you're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. you're a liar. but at least i know you're a liar. it's the people that don't know, like ann, that have to watch out.
graham, i swear to christ i'll kill your scrawny ass. now give me those tapes.
i need help? whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, graham? not me, buddy. you're the fucking nut. now show me those tapes.
anyway, i've always said, the work is the thing. i can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. and if ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what i'm saying? i mean, fuck.  jesus, what's takin' this guy?
thank god he was born an orphan. it would have killed his parents.
and you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
no. she ordered them special. took her forever to find them. they've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in sanskrit. we've got to go back. christine'll fucking crucify me.
i left my wallet. my credit cards, cash, fucking id, everything. we gotta go back.
no, i'm finished. i'm not a writer. i'm a middle-school english teacher. i'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. it's okay. i like books. the world doesn't give a shit what i have to say. i'm unnecessary.  i'm so insignificant, i can't even kill myself.
tastes like the back of a fucking la schoolbus. probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. fucking raid.
i'm going to be a fucking pariah. everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if i'm going to get drunk and make a scene. plus tony fucking levin?
no. no. you've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. now it's worse -- you're wasting away. teaching english to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. your books.
come on. you're fucking hungover.
where the fuck were you, man? i was dying in there. we were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
this nigger's breaking up my place, sheriff langston.
maybe you're right.  twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
you already do.  but my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  the disney corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
it's not the size of the role, viktor.  am i or am i not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... i want my nikes and i want them now!
grant? grant, i'm hungry. i'm so fuckin' hungry i think i'm gonna die.
starla covington. don't be ignorant. everyone knows that. fucking prom queen.
fuck lucky. never marry a damn half--mexican.
i never danced in a towel before.
'praise jesus?' that's fucking pushing it, margaret.
i hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen beaners up to west virginia.
look, i'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. besides, i'm impulsive. it runs in the family. we're all crazy. mind if i smoke?  anyway, today was the 'bid day.' but as i was walking down the aisle, i realized this is total insanity. what am i going to do in texas the rest of my life? i can't marry jerry jeff. i mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. so, halfway down the aisle, i turned and split. you think i'm nuts, right?
jack, if the rumors hold and israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. so what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
his law firm, same one that hired me. israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
answer your fucking pages! i've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean now!
cinnamon roll? no, good guess though. no, hugo that looks like jizz...  and i'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. the twist? it's my twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  so y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a tide commercial, i think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
jesus hugo! how is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? this is zero degree of difficulty man!
y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... y'had us for that. y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, i'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  so if you think i'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt i've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking mind!
this is him? the hitman hired to kill israel? he's a doctor?
hey, we nab israel, they pay t'get'm back, i'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. my thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some zip off the boat from naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
'spose to kill this fool named buddy israel.
well, if it's any comfort, i's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
fuck that nigga. let him go woof on some other scrub. we got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
i ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
the try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! i'm layin' niggas out.
when them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and i'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. once i get inside, i'mma put m'nina to israel's head and back out hot. anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. they get gully --
'cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. we hit whoever's between us and israel. i don't want to dead the whole floor and i don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
and you're not?  maybe you're my puppet.  but like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  it's the puppet's dream.  wondering if they're human!
it's not human, kelvin.  whatever it is, it's not human, and i am threatened by that.  evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. and i want to win.  i want humans to win.  so i am killing it before it kills me.
you're talking about a man in a white beard again.  you're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  human beings look for causes and patterns.  how could we know what solaris is up to, if anything?
you don't wash your clothes at the boulevard laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  a fuckin' joke?
i don't know why she bought me a tie! -- she's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and i could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
gentlemen, tomorrow morning the geneva man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the international convention. i am sure he will find we are treating you very well. you must not run around in your underwear. and take off the wash. the kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
killing his son was <u>stupid</u>! it made kirk willing to die.
oh, wow... i'll tell you what. when the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
this is very interesting. we are born knowing our history. we have other books. but not a book like this.
the only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
hey, he was going to kill you.  and this ratfuck paid to have iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
this piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  do you believe that? isn't that right, tran?  you pinhead.
come on!  if he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  whattya say?  just get your butt down here.  if i'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  it's 2203.  you writin'?
don't have a fucking coronary, lenny.
so you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  it happened!  the lapd executed one of the most important black men in america!  who the fuck are you to bury this?!
he's skull-fucking you, bud.  trying to get a reaction.  maybe pushing you to do something.
fucking. i'm talking about fucking, harold. you ever think of fucking other women?
watch out for dick low, he's a liar he has his own world. there was a junior agent in seattle, not unlike you, an agent who fell under dick's spell. he'd have done anything for agent low. richard got this agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  the agent died that night, killed by the suspect. richard low got him killed. worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. the suspect was george sheldon, the second man richard killed.
i want to catch dick low, more than you can imagine, but i cannot risk going public. what happens when the media finds out that a former fbi special agent, a founder of the behavioral sciences unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  you keep at it. we'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.
shut the fuck up or i'll shut you up.
zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. karen sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. evans was buried. when we get zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
no. cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
this is no random killing, no one shot deal. the unsub has killed before he's good at it. so what do we have?  we have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the fbi to know he exists.
yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. this by an unknown subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
i don't know. the whole judy garland thing kind of turned me on. does that makes me some kind of fag?
respect, my ass. they respect honesty. you see how they dress when they go out? they want to be noticed. you're just showing them it's working. you gotta get off this respect kick, baby. there ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
oh fuck that. you don't have to try and impress anyone. you think i give a shit? you think i sweat that skanky whore waitress...
you won. there's nothing to be sorry about. you're a winner. i'm the fuckin loser. i should be sorry.
pirates of the fucking caribbean.
we're gonna spend half the night driving around the hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. but, trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. i spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. and it's like i'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. i'm not gonna be one of those assholes. it's fucking depressing. some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? it makes me want to puke.
your girl friend.  she says she can't make it tonight.  you lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. i'll kill you, you bastard!
there are men in this world who demand to be killed.  they argue in gambling games they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. these people wander through the streets calling out "kill me, kill me."  luca brasi was like that. and since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...i made him my weapon.  because i was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  i think you have done the same with this man.
take me to america!  you need a good lupara in america?  you take me, i'll be the best man you got.  "oh say, can you seeee...by da star early light..."
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
i don't know why people say this country's civilised. it isn't. it's fucking primitive.
sure -- i know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! i'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, dickie, what do you really play?
ciao bello.  don't you want to fuck every woman you see. just once.
is it on "delle croce, just off the corso"? you're a quick study, aren't you? last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. that's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. i'll see you.
he wants to know if you killed freddie miles and then killed dickie greenleaf?
don't be naive. they can't kill everybody. they have different punishments for different things. like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. it's symbolic.
fuck it! fuck it! fuck it! fuck it! fuck it! fuck it! fuck it!
well, he should clean up this city here. it's full of filth and scum. scum and filth. it's like an open sewer. i can hardly take it. some days i go out and smell it then i get headaches that just stay and never go away. we need a president that would clean up this whole mess. flush it out.
are you out of your fucking mind? we're going to die.
you killed lauren! you killed her!
i know what this is...i picked you up when i was drunk and you probably thought i'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. but the thing is i know what i'm doing when i drink. i just usually don't care. right now, i do though. and i want you out. now.
i know!  i'd tell you if i knew! goddamn!  i know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  i'm trying to remember everything!  find that fucking kid.  he probably knows something.
i think i've really fucked up.  i think i've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  why didn't we just go straight to the police.
i just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  did you see his butt?  darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  you could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
didn't they tell you? that hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. you got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
bet your ass you are. now i don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. you gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
you fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and i wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  you crossed the line, man.
fucking sickening.
-- you listen to me. nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. you're fucking here right now because of the kennedys. they may be wrong. they make mistakes. but they're not weak. the weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
you were in the room. it was your purview. it was your job to make sure bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. you've got the most important job in the world right now. you're the smartest guy the president has.  besides me.
you know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your puerto ricans? well out here we got indians. that's just the way it is.
you ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking everglades, mister.
no. i consulted it. we're going into indian country, i wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. don't you?
i can't be dicking around here. that's all i'm saying. i don't carry crystals, i don't wanna come back in another life. i just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
maybe you're not aware of this, crow horse, but i just flew in from a place called the twentieth century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, dna fingerprinting i don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. leo was killed right here.
-- leo was an apple, that's right. red on the outside, white on the inside. and jimmy hated him. kicked his ass a coupla times. but he didn't kill him.
you ever think about killing another human being?
never mind.  wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  that'll muffle the signal.
get your story straight.  this idiot's been trying to kill me since i went to rekall.  --you don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
you see, quaid, none of my people could get close to kuato.  the fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  so hauser and i sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
a car, huh?  like a big armored car?  need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
reckon he hated perfection more than us?  you suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
demerol? what the fuck is your problem, man? you wanna die?
you fucking swear to shut up!
i think he hired shu to kill jimmy chin... it wasn't a chinatown gang hit -- jimmy chin and art's wife were lovers! she just about told me...!
i don't have time to read every word in every report, i'm too busy getting killed in court... meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where chuckie-fucking-roeder works!
good. now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the chinatown shooting. we honestly don't give a shit about the kennedy assassination.
i'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. if that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off i'll live with, ed.
can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
a trailer was here. what the hell do you think?
i am not going to cliff's trailer.
that's not the way to cliff's trailer. i told you.
god. i'm beginning to lose faith in the united states government and that includes the telephone system. don't you folks talk to one another. that's her trailer there and i haven't touched a god damn thing. agent chet desmond come by a second time and asked too see deputy cliff howard's trailer  ...which i showed him. i went back to my trailer...  after that i never saw him again.
no, hey, i already told this whole damn thing to sheriff "not-quite- able"... here's the trailer now.
mrs. simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. teresa rented it about a month ago.
federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond and agent sam stanley. sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see teresa banks' trailer, please.
what are you doing here in the trailer court, deputy?
it was a year ago today that teresa banks was killed. i'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
agent chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. he had me drive the van with the body back here. which we did. it was 105 miles.
we do notice things, don't we, agent desmond? are you going back to the trailer park for the blue rose?
in that case, we should go to the canyon trailer park.
i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park.
you're not bob are you, harold? if you are, you can kill me right now. kill me right now, if you are.
well, maybe you better do that, then.  you know you guys are all the same. you don't care who gets hurt. you're a bunch of whores. you'd do anything for a dollar. you got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
'you guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
that's the point, you stupid fuck. let them buy it. we let them buy the case. that's what i took it for. you let this drop -- we'll go up to new hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
...i get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- i get this expert doctor to talk to you. i'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. you're 'sposed to be in court. i bet you haven't even seen the file.
a huge law firm. okay? they put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'you must drop by with pat and me...' okay...?
no, on the campus.  i haven't any family.
will you shut up?  you sound like my fucking sister.
no.  hate the fear inside of you! climb like a man mister!  hate it! hate it away.  hate your way up one more rung!!  do it right now!!
bobby peru grab you now... hold you tight... feel everythin' in you now... stay quiet... say "fuck me" and then i'll leave.
you know, i really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... can you fuck like that?... you like it like a bunny?... huh?... cause baby, i'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... jump all around in that hole... bobby peru doesn't come up for air.
guilty on a reduced charge. hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. you seen it. plain filth.
don't fuck with me, man. you look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
i knew this would happen. soon as that piece of filth got out of pee dee, i knew there'd be trouble. he's just got some kind of influence over her i can't decipher. there's somethin' wild in lula i don't know where it comes from. you gotta find 'em, johnnie.
he owes god money. you know, he queered himself for good with esquire.
shut up, james. you're annoying. carrie and howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? the entire class combined -- including the lovely hannah green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
walter's on campus, being the good soldier for wordfest. but he's a basket case. someone stole marilyn's jacket last night. and poe's missing, too.
i might have his number on campus.
fucking mariners.
i remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor annette married." except her brother. you treated me with respect.  look, you paid your dues. your slate is clean now.
if she's here tomorrow, i'll fucking kill her.
whatever my ideas are of being a jew is not going to help you.  why don't we continue this on thursday.
what is your idea of being a jew?
well, walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but i like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
so, you're not a dyke.
i thought you were a dyke.
not us.  not human.  get it?  something non- human, but intelligent...
you know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
fuck the bonus.  i hate heights.  you wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
you think we're being set up?--christ, deep throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the white house and up traipses marilyn naming names.
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the montana bureau--
by "they" you mean the white house, don't you?  your buddy from usc, dwight chapin-- he works for the white house.
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --i'm not going to kick ass over this, but i'd like you to know i hate getting beat, i just hate it-- don't forget that i hate it--
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse mr. haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in america of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the white house--  --it would be nice if we were right--
attitude?  me?  i think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  we're in this together. don't back out on me now!
oh my fucking god.  you're gay.
you know what. kill me. cut out my fucking heart. go on! do it!
shut up! you fucking shut up! what do you want? huh? what the hell do you want?
roussel? you mean claude? you're calling dr. demento so he can come paint my face again? fuck that.
so's woody allen.  no, your uncle really helped me. i was sort of messed up for a while. wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. he kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  you know, he and claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. totally dedicated.
fan-fucking-tastic?
what good can you do? why are you being so fucking stupid?
"fuck"? you think i don't know this word "fuck"? is that how you talk to policemen in america?
no. but i'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
eight o'clock. shit. you'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
fuck you! if i'm gonna kill myself i'll do it when i'm good and ready! you can go to hell!
stop it! i did so kill them! and i'm going to kill anastasia.
yeah, well... you- she hates jews. she thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, i mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. i'm tellin' yuh.
well, uh...  you're what grammy hall would call a real jew.
wh- how am i a paran-? well, i pick up on those kind o' things. you know, i was having lunch with some guys from nbc, so i said... uh, "did you eat yet or what?" and tom christie said, "no, didchoo?" not, did you, didchoo eat? jew? no, not did you eat, but jew eat? jew. you get it? jew eat?
no, i'm not. we were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "jew."
i distinctly heard it. he muttered under his breath, "jew."
you're fucking desperate.
pictures.  they're always in my tote.  i left my tote in the damn trailer.  but! he's mac all over again.  imagine mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  the fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
i wasn't part of that picture at all, was i?  i wasn't part of that decision.  did i occur to you at all?  it's a fucking farce.  it's a fucking farce.  how long did you think you could keep it going. you're amazing.  do you have any idea what you've done to us?
don't make allowances.  i'll never be ready.  some people just shouldn't have children.  i'd be a terrible fucking mother, joe.  i did want it for us.  but i couldn't do it.  i don't really think i can do it.
okay.  if we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. because i don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  and the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  that you don't have... oh christ, sally.
and how fucking dare you cast skye davidson in that part?  have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  i'm an actress!  it's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  everybody knows that...
you want to talk about bullshit?  lucy called you three times this week.  she's a fucking mess, joe.  your sister is a fucking mess.  she needs you.  i talk to her more than you do.
they can't find a sitter...  hello?  excuse me?  yes, uh, hold on.  just a moment.  it's skye davidson.  she needs directions to the house.  you invited skye fucking davidson to our anniversary party?
otis!!  shostakovich identified with the jew.  he felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of stalinist imperialism.
oh, okay, forgive me.  your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
well, i have some paper towels --
you know, i can remember once, getting back below the dmz -- and the first americans we ran into were a track squadron. i just couldn't believe how much water they had. we'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. and there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. i could've killed them.  i swear to god i would have, too, if ...
then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. poking pins in her an' all that. sergeant says, don't do her like that. you leave your shitty little hands off that girl. gook lieutenant says fuck you in vietnamese -- sergeant says, don't do that again. you'll wish you hadn't. then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the playboy mag. man, it blew him clean off the dock -- hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
i don't get it -- you said your mission was to kill him. let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. this  kurtz is ruining the war i mean, this don't look good for america !
fucking savages.
that's right, the little gook- pricks. but they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. because they fight with their guts, like animals. and for an idea ! that's rich. we fight with ingenious machines and fire, like gods, and for nothing. but i'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. we'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. how do you like the doors': 'c'mon baby light my fire...'
all you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  you don't understand shit!  trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  who's protecting us?  i've seen plenty like you.  so -more-
don't judge me.  you're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
bastards killed sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
thanks for being on time... carol, the waitress, this is simon, the fag.
yes. i'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to baltimore.
i've got jews at my table.
police! police! fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  assault and battery and you're black.
where are all your queer party friends?
now i'll tell you something.  it wouldn't fucking matter if i offered you one hundred million dollars. you'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. and here i am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing i can think is that, in just a few minutes i'm going to take you.
if you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
boy, that's fucking genius.  you're a fucking genius.  then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. man, no way i coulda done that!
but they caught the guy.  i heard it all.  sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  shooting anybody.  drugs, probably.
we fuck like minks.  we forget the rugrats.  we live happily ever after.
we fuck like minks.  we raise rugrats.  we live happily ever after.
they fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
i'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way i described in my book. i'd be announcing myself as the killer.  i'm not stupid.
don't you get it, gus?  if beth killed johnny boz to frame catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at berkeley.  it gives her the motive to kill nilsen.
you... fucked her!  goddamn dumb sonofabitch... you fucked her! goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
how you're saying she killed her parents?  did she kill bobby vasquez, too?
people are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
oh man, you a fine nigga! you know that?
'uppity?' like as in 'uppity nigger?'
oh man! folklore guy  worked on the railroad. y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. then one day they invented a machine to do it. and he says "fuck that, i'm a man" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. it takes two days. neck and neck the whole time. they get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  got a cigarette?
would you shut the fuck up? you hear what i'm doing?
you look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
you fucking little whore! you sold my painting! i'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! believe that shit.
fuck band practice... if you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like tony bennett..
you killed me, batman killed me, penguin killed me.  three lives down.  got enough bullets to finish me off?
go on, kill me too.  just as you killed my wife.
dick, you were reckless.  you could have been killed.
nygma. edward nygma. you hired me. personally. just like i tell everyone.  well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
we don't kill. killing is what damns you. it-. what am i talking about? this conversation is over. you're going away to school.
listen, dick. killing two-face won't take the pain away. it'll make it worse.
kill me? well, alright. go ahead. take the empire. all yours.  hell, harv, old pals. i'll kill me for you.
you could've killed him, you know. you could've killed the joker.
you scum!  you sick filth!... you did that to her!
okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the white house! jumpin' jesus! i want everyone there. our people. locals. orders are shoot to kill. repeat! shoot to kill!
hell no!  i'm rolling.  i'm a businessman.  i'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>beee</u>tel <u>jooose</u>!  <u>who</u> do i gotta kill?
forget him.  he'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  you need to worry about people like <u>otho</u>.  there are a lot of phony trance mediums.  they usually can't make the formulas work, but if otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  as in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
i mean, i am really attracted to you. jesus, you are a fag. we can share recipes, if you like, darlene.
you're a fag or a liar.
christ, you're not a fag are you? because i don't want to be wasting my time.
think, jew florist?
what i know is what i see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
ain't no new negroes in this town i don't know about. what she look like? you sure that wasn't denver?
tell me something, stamp. tell me this one thing. how much is a nigger supposed to take?
they'll know. they'll know as soon as they born. cause it's inside us,stamp. it'll be inside them. we'll pass it down. schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
she's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  i'm just helping her conceive, man!
there's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  that's what ransom is.  those are the fucking rules.
shut the fuck up, donny.  not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a soviet tank.  this is not a worthy--
shut the fuck up, donny.  we'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. we'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  million fucking clams. and yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  our fucking troubles are over, dude.

shut the fuck up, donny.
--had a rough night, and i hate the fucking eagles, man--
fuck you man!  you don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
i like it too.  it's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. it can be a natural, zesty enterprise. but unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "johnson".
you make everything a fucking travesty!
goddamnit walter!  you fucking asshole!
we're scattering the fucking ashes!
it's just part of your whole sick cynthia thing.  taking care of her fucking dog.  going to her fucking synagogue.  you're living in the fucking past.
you're fucking polish catholic--

we know it's his fucking homework, walter!  where's the fucking money, you little brat?
fuck your sympathy!  i don't need your sympathy, man, i need my fucking johnson!
i figure my only hope is that the big lebowski kills me before the germans can cut my dick off.
they're gonna kill her, walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
and what do they got, dude?  my dirty undies.  my fucking whites--say, where is  the car?

you're fucking twenty minutes late. what the fuck is that?
what the fuck are you talking about?! this chinaman is not the issue!  i'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, dude.  across this line you do not, uh--and also, dude, chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . asian- american.  please.
huh?  no!  what the fuck are you talking--i'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
there's no fucking reason--here's my point, dude--there's no fucking reason--
shut the fuck up.  hello?
look at that fucking phony, dude! pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
am i? you think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? they can't. they're afraid of you.  the humans fear us because we're superior. they fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? spare me the uncle tom routine. you can't keep denying what you are. you're one of us, blade. you always have been.
this is funny?? this is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  you pricks! i'll see you in fucking court!!
--fuck your bullshit pieties! you were the next to die, asshole!
i don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, i'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but i've got to get the fuck out of here, and i'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
we're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
it's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
from-the-movie-mary-brown, trailer park bible psycho?
you're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, nick. and it fucked up anna, and did something to domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. and i don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. and then the other. and then the other. it's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
jesus, you don't think i know that? you don't think i've tried? she won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
whatever--all i know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
what're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
the point is we don't serve niggers here.
from the neighborhood?  shut the fuck up.  you like telephones? huh?. you wanta go for a ride?
don't look at me, fuck. i shoot when i see the whites of the eyes.  you like me?.

man.  fuck you guys.  i have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
you're a fucking amateur!
you guys are such babies.  you want to go home, go.  me, i'm not going to stop until i find the fucking motherlode.
i want my kid out of protective custody. now.  no fucking around.  my wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  i sign when they call me safe and sound.
derek foreal.  derek foreal.  derek fucking foreal.  alright?  the answer to all your dreams.  are you happy now?
then relax.  it's a federal bank. guaranteed by the government.  and senor noriega has very lenient banking principles.  no questions.  no problems. all the pesados keep their money here. even el padrino.  what do you worry? everyone knows we are with escobar.  who is going to fuck with us?
what's the matter?  we're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
is she here?  george, kristina hates you.  you fucked her over one too many times.  and i'm not here to socialize. did you hear about diego?
my problem?  we're broke, that's my fucking problem.  and you're a fucking spy.
you know, he's got a point.  we're fucking americans.  we stick out like sore thumbs.
what's the matter, george?  something wrong?  you look like you just fucked your mother.
you killed him.  you killed him -- and i got you off.
what's your problem with crippled dick?
no?  that mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? what are you going to do now?  kill us? kill us all?
he'll kill them.  he'll kill every last one of them.
bullshit, you killed him.  not me. you did it because you couldn't stand the thought of johnnie fucking you.
i hate that little fuck!  i hate him!  i hate him!  i should've done him!
jesus christ, violet!  open your fucking eyes!  johnnie hates me like i hate him!
it was unbelievable!  un-fucking- believable!
what?  it ain't no big fuckin' deal. i know who don hires.  did you know he did time himself?

un-fucking-believable.  i called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
oh christ, the phone ...  that was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
these people are serious, violet. if you want to know how serious, ask shelly.  they're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  you fuck them, you've got to do it right.
wait a minute.  wait a minute.  do you have any idea what you are saying? you are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
let me guess.  this is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  that inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
we're all whores, frank. you know what i'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
she's no whore, marcus.
we're gonna save you, noel. you're gonna be all right.  do it, tom! i'll call for fucking backup, i swear!
turn here. you missed it. the chink is on 3rd.
another thing i can't stand is ...when white house reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "white house" sources say...
ah, my fool is dead.  he was careless, always.  still, i'll pull out your tongue for that.  don't you understand?  i've killed you a dozen times.  your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  i have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  a thousand years, and more. i have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and i have bathed in the blood of emperors.
i'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  come on, merrick.  football.  afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
i'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  i mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...i mean i'm getting it--
it's the best, nuke...the absolute fucking best.
these guys back home don't give a fuck about the supreme court and any of this bullshit! they want things to quiet down. they want you to walk away from -
hey, sammy, tell this jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
get this through your head, you jew motherfucker, you. you only exist out here because of me!  that's the only reason!  without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' jew ass! then where you gonna go?!  you're fuckin' warned! don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! you motherfucker, you!
i'm what counts out here! not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' tv shows! and what the fuck are you doin' on tv anyhow?!
where's my head? where's your fuckin' balls? huh? you know i'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. you know what i'm talkin' about, huh? you know!  if you're actin' like this now, how can i depend on you?  there's a lot of things gonna change out here. and if you wanna be there with me, sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
then he called me a faggot.
get the fu-  you threatening me?  i'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  get up and go home right now.
you fuckin' whore!
look, i tried to do this thing. i know that you want me to, but it's just - you know, i'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. you know, i'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. i don't want to do it anymore.  where's amy?
yes, i want to kill you! i hate your fuckin' guts!
but even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
how could you say that?  you're a beautiful woman. you're destroying yourself. you don't need that stuff. you don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. i know you better than you know yourself. you're a tiger, you're stronger than i am. and when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  you can do it.  you can do it.
and don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. you understand?
you're goin' out to las vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. what the fuck? i mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
you know... i think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. i think in all fairness, i should explain to you what it is that i do. for instance, tomorrow morning i'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, i'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. and just about the time that i'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. and guess what?  i'll split your fuckin' head open again. because i'm fuckin' stupid. i don't give a fuck about jail.  that's my business. that's what i do. and we know what you do, don't we, charlie? you fuck people out of money and get away with it.
you fuckin' faggot! do you know who you're fuckin' with?
you called my friend a faggot? you tell him to go fuck himself?
do you see that? dumb jew motherfucker. grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. i know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the jew's wife, would he? because if he is... it's a problem.
i'm not gonna kill him. shut the fuck up. what, do you know what you're talkin' about? i'm not killing anyb-
if it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
he's so fuckin' lucky. i could have buried him. i could have gone to europe and taken the baby. and then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
he could have killed him! okay? he could have killed him.
you know... the first time i ever saw your guys together... i never saw him so happy. i mean, i know he's a crazy jew fuck and everything, but...
you're gonna fuckin' kill her. take it easy.
and when i'm ready, i'll say the words, 'go see the jew.'
well, now, sure they're askin'. they earn with the prick. i got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  i'm not sure yet, you know. but i w- you know, but you know what i want you to do?
he asked me again about you and the jew's wife.
he asked me again about you and the jew's wife.
sue me, you jew fuck!
fuckin' jews stick together, don't they?
...bosses. i mean, they're smokin' their di nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [italian-american slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? while, if i wanna talk private, i gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to palm spring or arizona... la. i had a couple of sand niggers out there. you know, arabs.
kill you,  you motherfucker you!  frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
kill me, you fuck, kill me.

the kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like mexican angels.  i know you're a woman. do you?
i improved on the fucking original.
that's illegal.  you want us pulled over?  i'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
what are you planning to do when they got here?  they'll kill us. they'll kill rachel.
you fucking promised.
i'm getting emotional. and i don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, hennessy?
you're on duty. keep your fucking mouth shut. go in and get some sleep.
the poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
"go back to your banana tree, nigger." no use telling them i came from tottenham.
it was a job. so i get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
shut the fuck up, would you?
tom sisler. he was murdered at school. two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
we're all manipulated. from the moment we're born. the event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before i was even born.
it's like a pop your cherry party. everyone's saying it's 'fuck or die' time.
my dad acts like he's johnny fucking perfect and he's really johnny fucking rapist.
people thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
they were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. and she was  a loner. an angry girl that no one really liked. she'd called them 'queers'.
unbe-fucking-lievable.
unbe-fucking-lievable.
i'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. i'm gonna--  don't tell me to shut-- it's none of your business.  man, i can talk all i want to.
andy.  another fuckin'...
'course i'm respectable. i'm old. politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. i'll double whatever your fees are and i'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find hollis' girlfriend.
sorry. look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. excuse me. then you ask me to lie to the police.
shut the fuck up!  ...yes i remember nothing, miss sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
neither do i, actually. but you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
it's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. there's blood all over the floor, like a lake. and through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
where's the towel?
queer?
yes, sir - yes, sir, i knew how to handle the old man.  he was kind of queer, but i knew how to handle him.
it's a trach ring. it's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. this one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
i'm gonna break your fucking head! you fucking jerkoff!
we get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? fuck! fuck! fuck! fuck!!  i'm not even supposed to be here today!
what responsibility? you're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
do you need a hug or something? 'cause i would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. just don't knead my ass when you do it.
fuck you. fuck you, pal. listen to you trying to pass the buck again. i'm the source of all your misery. who closed the store to play hockey? who closed the store to attend a wake? who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? you wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  "i'm not even supposed to be here today."  you sound like an asshole. whose choice was it to be here today? nobody twisted your arm. you're here today of your own violation, my friend. but you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if dante wasn't here. well, i got news for you, jerk: this store would survive without you. without me either. all you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: you push fucking buttons. any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. you work in a convenience store, dante. and badly, i might add. and i work in a shitty video store.  badly, as well.  you know, that guy jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. us?  we like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-god forbid- cigarettes. we look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?
...if i wasn't such a fucking coward.  it must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
if you want caitlin, then face veronica, tell her, and be with caitlin. if you want veronica, be with veronica. but don't pine for one and fuck the other. man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
i'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, i smell like shoe polish, i've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
would you shut the fuck up?  who the fuck is in the bathroom?
no, because you won't admit to it. as if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. you're as curious as the rest of us, pal. you've tried it.
he broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
exactly. in order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  all they know is killing and white uniforms.
you don't know what you want, but i'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! i've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. i even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if i was with you. everyone said it was a stupid move, but i didn't care because i loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. and now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
...and one of those guys was you! the last one, i might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that i've been faithful to you since we met! all the other guys i went with before i met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  but don't look at me like i'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
thirty-seven?!  my girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
how many dicks have you sucked?!
i hate this fucking place.
oh shit, look who it is. the human vacuum.
he's got his own band in moscow. it's called "fuck your yankee blue jeans" or something like that.
kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  when you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  go figure.  move on tucker, time is short.
cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. he rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
one half bar of chocolate. one bunch of keys on white metal ring. one packet of cigarettes. two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. one pocket comb - black plastic. one address book - imitation red leather. one ten penny piece. one white metal wristlet watch, "timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. anything else in your pockets?
<u>kill</u> you!  he's coming to kill you!
i said.  get the gun.  out.  of my fucking <u>face.</u> before i wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
lemme tell you something.  vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  nobody even know what he looked like until now...
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
<u>my hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
...well, last i checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, i'd suggest an attitude shift...
what are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  kill us?  go ahead, man! <u>shoot</u>...my ass.
look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the comoros.  how much you got saved?
pull your head out of your ass.  get your thinking straight.  you wanna die?
that's the point.  you play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  that's not living.  that's dying a little every day.  not me, pal.  it's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  that's jazz.  that guy up there, he knows what i'm talking about.  hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  you can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
don't take that.  tell him to shut the fuck up.
i should only kill people after i get to know 'em?  six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  get in the fucking car.
stop acting like a silly little fag!
don't talk to me about courage.  i know death, what it's like to kill. you're not a killer -- you watched daryll lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  you chocked.  i know something <u>else</u> about you.
inspector halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is i don't give a fuck.  that's the upside of having a breakdown.
christ.  i didn't lock the fucking drawer!  you spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  you can't imagine how many times i saw you two... your head together, i wish him dead.  every time... want to hear something weird?  i feel like i'd give my life to bring him back.
you said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? this doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
so i'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  you fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  there's something i want you to think about.  the book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. you tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  to what end?  you're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  go get drunk.  i am.
you want mine, too?  you take his, you take mine.  i'm the one fucked it up...
what for? the minute i get him some other gavone will take his place. i've been doing this for twenty years. when i retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
fuck bastaldi and his brother. these tapes are gold. do you have any idea what zammito would pay to get them back?
we are tired and bored with your bullshit. so, put that stupid little knife away before zero shoves it up your ass.
don't tell me to be cool! we were supposed to be in and out. in and out! in the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the mafia... the fbi... the chicago police department and a group of latin gang members after us. i haven't left out anyone, have i?  i don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
who gives a fuck!  i'm a businessman.  you gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  aaaaaa!  goddd!
kill the men who killed you both, and the day of the dead will be your reunion.
i shit you not. mcconnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. we'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. you know -  "what are you doing, man? i'm not a fag. i'll kick your ass if you say anything."  it's like, for christsakes greg, you're gay, deal with it. the only reason why i let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a hoover.
unbelievable. some fag, no offense -
sebastian, you faggot. is she with you?
racist piece of shit.
i'm sorry, but unfortunately i don't fuck losers.
oh gee, your journal. could you be more queer?
lovely. how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali? zipping through my inheritance per usual?
do you care to tell me what mrs. white-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
no, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. they too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
if that child comes here...if i find her trying to steal your love from me...i'll kill her. yes, i'll kill her:
no! not fucked him, i think i killed him.
no. i quit. take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
here's a towel.
i mean we can still... whatever... maybe i should get a towel?
it's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. and his eyes were open. that always bugs me out. do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
she's got a hidden pitbull. maybe she hired someone to kill them.
just souvenirs.  towels and stuff.
you're....you're disgusting! you're....filth!
i'll kill you!! i'll fucking kill you!! i'll do it! i'll do it! i'm not playin' around here!
joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, albert! i mean, what do you think?
c'est tres amusant... you have been promoted. and to a jew... i am joking of course. naturellement. seriously, nick, may i hope that you have come to play?
wait! first i give you special fuck!
i show you. come. you come.  linda have special, crazy fuck. that right?
how you like to have nice fuck with linda? you like that? special, crazy fuck just like with linda?
those fuckin' niggers. this time i'm going to eat balls!... you ever try 'em?
look at that, see... watch. wait a minute, watch. there! d'j'u see that? d'j'u see the way he... you know what that guy is doing? that guy is squeezing her ass!
i'll kill 'em. anybody bothers you, i'll kill 'em!
how's the trailer?
you're a fucking nut. you know that, merle? you're a fucking maniac!
you know what i think? there's times i think you're a goddamn faggot!... i fixed you up a million times, merle!  i fixed him up a million times! i don't know how many times i fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... zilch! zero!... the trouble with you, merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "this is this"? what does that mean, "this is this"? i mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! and if it isn't, what the hell is it???
you're one fuckin' bastard, merle. you know that? you're one fucking bastard!
ah, fuck you, wade.  this is bull- shit.  you're not going to kill me.  you're not going to risk your freedom.
jury found you guilty, not me.  i just called it as i saw it.  fuck that.  you were brought here for a reason.  doucet's escaped.  re-animated for his parole hearing.  killed a lot of people.  most of them cops.
you two fucks listen up.  doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit technothugs.
kill him... kill him.
that's just it.  he never did time. seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  judge threw out the cases each time.  either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
you're wrong, mr. stone. there are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. they can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- and some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. well, i hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. you'll meet the fire-eaters and the circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. but if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the allegheny mountains.
i know -- that was mighty queer medford -- knew it the minute i tasted it. but it takes more than that to down daniel webster.
queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
'yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  now you are fucked.
i've seen enough phoney id's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  add all that up and i don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
-- recognizing phony id's?  christ, powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
listen, it's late already when i realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and sal.  i couldn't get a baby sitter.
heidi, for christ sake, shut up! will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
all right, enough!  who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  is that you moretti?  you on the phone?  will somebody talk to me?
i gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  and we're gonna go, man!
i'm getting out of here, man.  i'm not going to stay here and i'm not giving up.  i mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  so fuck it!  but, if i can get out of this... i am going to get out. and, how i'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and i'm flying the fuck out... that's all, leon.  if you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  you're free to do what you want.
when i'm bein' fucked, i like to be kissed a lot.  who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  you're a city cop, where's the fbi?  this is a federal offense, i got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  you know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  now god damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
they'll shoot you the fucking cops'll shoot you ... they don't give a damn.  in spite of that bank insurance.  you see what they did in attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.
you realize, sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... you gotta mother or a father? friends?  if we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  any country. just name a country.
i'm a fuckup and an outcast.  there isn't one single person in my life i haven't hurt through my love. you understand that?  i'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if i love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
i said you were never a faggot.
fuckin' a! we got a five hour drive back to la ahead of us. <b> ext. macdonald's -- parking lot -- moments later </b> choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back parking lot of the macdonald's. alf is hosing him down. domino stares at choco... admiring his body.
i fucked up. you can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. all you've done is put a death sentence on meeka.
you motherfuckin' tino. you fucked us so bad.
don't fuck with us, edna! there are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
just shut up and do what they say. they're gonna kill us if we don't, ian.
him no white.  him no white.
negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.
mookie, you must think i'm stupid or something.  you're gonna run outta here and i won't see your black ass for another week.
sounds funny to me.  as much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
i'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood.  i don't like being around them, they're animals.
twenty minutes.  how come you niggers are so stupid?
mookie, you're fucking up.
sal's famous pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  see, pop, mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  he's making us lose business.
no lloyd. chicks are for fags - i'm not going to do it.
who cares? chicks are for fags.
you know, "some". the fag stuff.
no. no. that's not it. we don't kill him. we don't kill anybody. but i like the way you're thinking. you're focused and you're trying to follow. no, what we need to do is start a fake special needs class.
oh, tract housing, huh?  i guess i shouldn't complain about my duplex in burbank.  what a dump. some places have a murphy bed, this place has a murphy <u>shower</u>.  i still don't know where to hang the towels!
say it a little louder.  i don't think bela heard you in his trailer.
that was karloff.  paul, you gotta try harder.  i don't want this film to be haif-assed. this time, we go for the quality.
you mean like a date?  i thought you were a fag.
i'm a whore!  your bathrooms are filthy!
why shouldn't i be in a place like this? i'm a whore!
i'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. we were just... i was just experimenting.
imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  but don't stop there.  extrapolate.  imagine the police in control.  it's big, lad.
him and me both.  <u>fucking exley</u>.
it'll look like justice.  that's what that fat fuck got.  <u>justice</u>.
and you fuck people up for a living.  that don't make me you. <u>capisce</u>, shitbird?
you ain't woofin' i did.  stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
jack was a shame, but dick stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  through his whore girl friend.  i sent him to make the buy.  the rest is history.
high line whores.  with plastic surgery to look like movie stars. and who knows what else?  it's run by this guy pierce patchett.  you want to talk to him?
do you make the three negroes for the nite owl killings?
you're playing an angle, college boy.  you're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  if they're making you a detective, watch out.  some bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
is the veronica lake look-alike one of your whores?
jackie, all i know is what you know.  the man is very rich.  and he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  but that's it. patchett's what i like to call 'twilight.'  he ain't queer, he ain't red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
he's queer too.  metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  on screen and off.  i'm getting him to fuck the d.a. for a hundred bucks.  that's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
don't know.  i'm chasing picture books.  fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  it's well done stuff.  i thought you might have heard something.
we did a piece last year. 'ingenue dykes in hollywood.'  her name got mentioned.
working whores with squad two.
fuckin-a.
you had an affair with this woman, robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
this guy's a fat-assed rotarian gasbag.
this is fucked. you don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
i'm sorry. i'm not sure i understand. you wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
fuck you. you may have to--
fuck you. you may have to what?
i don't <u>know</u> you, i don't <u>know</u> your name, i don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but i'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! get it?!
i sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. why can't i bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
those maps belong to his majesty's government.  they're confidential. they shouldn't be left lying around for any tom, dick or mary to have sight of.
you get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. i thought i would kill you.  you killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  but the girl was always here, like some guardian angel.
because you young americans think the world began when you were born. you fall apart when you don't get your own way.
fuck legal terms.  we're talking about human beings here.  sick people.  a whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  they need their money now!  we gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, ed.  we gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
kinda like david and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- i'll do it.  i'll take it on.
bullshit.  you're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  fuck if i'll help you do that.
open and shut?  <u>open and fucking shut</u>?
that's all you got, lady.  two wrong feet. in fucking ugly shoes.
it wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
well, i'm the neighbors.  there, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
look, father this is hard for you- please. but for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. i mean this kind of sickness. you'd know that.
shove it up your ass you faggot!
it wasn't professional, jack.  it was a stunt. a stupid-ass stunt.
what-are you?  a fucking moron? it's three o'clock in the morning, frank.  who's watching?  your wife? maybe you can get us a gig playing little frank's birthday party. what do you think?
a gift.  courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, mr. daniels.  we, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  yup.  they want us back.  easter.  it seems they have this egg hunt every year.  only not for kids. adults.  they stuff these plastic eggs with timexes and little certificates for free mai tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  then afterwards, they have a dance.  an egg dance.  everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  it's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. slippery business.
we might as well do the towels the same way.
and it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and i. this evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady jack and i are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  she's making her debut here this evening and, as far as i'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the ambassador lounge.  ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, miss susie diamond.
i mean, i'd hate to think i'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
you've given me the freedom i haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways i never thought possible.  but hell -- this is america.  one day a pauper, the next day, a prince. and i owe it all to you. now if you'll excuse me, i've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  excuse me -- i mean "make love to."
of course i killed them, you dumb fuck.  and torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  swallow this one, commander. you are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
cmon, evelyn thompsons got no class.  she doesnt marry dr. steve, the womans living in a trailer.
not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
it means killing benes...  and for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  damn it to hell!
shut the fuck up or i'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
you're there in thirty minutes or i find you, jerry, and i shoot you, and i shoot your fucking wife, and i shoot all your little fucking children, and i shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. got it?
that's a fucking great, man!  fucking great! congratulations.
tyler durden!  tyler durden, you fucking freak.  what's going on?  i'm coming over there...
you fuck me, then snub me.  you love me, you hate me.  you show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, tyler?
i've been going to debtor's anonymous.  you want to see some truly fucked up people?
fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
how'd you do that?!  you're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
fuck damnation.  fuck redemption.  we are god's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
we need some towels, lou.  we need replacement light bulbs.
look, stupid fuck, i want everyone outta here now!
relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
ahhh! fuck! you fucking asshole. you think this is funny, you fucking dick? tod, if you're not dead i'm gonna fucking kill you!
fag.
his father's pretty fucked up with denial. maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
that's a crock.  we don't say that. do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? if it went public?  the white house would have to act through channels. we're talking ransom.  four billion bucks in war reparations to vietnam to get the others back.  that's billion, colonel.  with a "b".  for a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  a pain in the ass to everybody?  no way. there's no way.
...so he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...i said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... i said, there's the door - take a trip.
you're calling <u>lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. you must think i'm some dope.  you fuckin' bastard... you...  ... stay out all night long...
..ha...little fella? i mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of central park. i should be surprised? i'm not surprised. i'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
well that's stupid. this is my park just as much as it is theirs. you think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
i take it back - you're fucking deranged... and you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
you can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
<u>nothing!</u> <u>they</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>gentlemen!</u>
<u>fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
you a fag too?
not dirt. see, dirt isn't bad. it's filth. filth is bad. that's what starts maggots and riots...
in my personal thing, i don't see that. i'm seeing more filth. a lot of filth. what they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. and uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
well, you're not that bad, but some people... i mean, people's homes, just filth. i've been in people's homes...
so, your husband hired me to kill him. that's the truth.
can i borrow your towel for a minute?
fag?  ass?  i'm sorry, is that a joke?
some fag.  charged me up the ass.
your timing swallows the massive one. grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss don, and we can't do shit.  don't even ask about those discs. goddamn that art mooney with a star by his name!  it's tied to johnny's c.d., i know.
su-ure.  two people hired me to find zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  but it's not necessary.  people are dead.  one was a friend.  the same people were involved in a scam to rip off grendel records. bottom line's julian grendel is doing a little revenge number...
tonight after i see don. some beverly hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. name's colleen sutton.
fucking australians!  i hate that country, continent, what is it? don't we do nuclear testing there?
who do you think you are, ford? the tooth fairy.  kill!  kill!  kill!
as clark gable said to ava gardner in mogambo:  'fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
once i got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. i didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... you were in too many discos during the seventies.  the village people rotted your brain.
<u>i.  am.  the.  biggest.  sissy.</u> <u>in.  the.  whole.  fucking.  world</u>.
accident?  accident!  you naive pussball, when i realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  i <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so i'd only hear <u>my</u> music. here, look.
how could grendel records sign such a wick-prick?  i guess julian grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  i hear ray charles is going to head up the video division.
a piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
a bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
never trust a nigger.
where'd you get this fag shit?
go watch the game?  go watch the fucking game?  frank, they're gonna make you for sissy clark's murderer.  it matches the nightingale's profile.  you understand what that means?
he killed her john.  he killed her and i didn't do a thing to stop it.
he didn't just kill three women anymore. he killed ten.
whatta ya know.  bayside, born and raised.
you're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
i've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  as you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with hindus and muslims and sikhs and jews and persians.  the temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the pranami. it was hindu of course but the priests used to read from the muslim koran and the hindu gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as god was worshipped.
you bloody whore. frank was too careful to die like that. who killed him?
yes.  i said, "not actually." the fuck you care, george?  we're just talking...
that's what i'm saying.  we were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to jerry graff.
look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  no.  you're absolutely right, and i want to tell you something.
and so they kill the goose.  i, i, i'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
the whole fuckin' thing...the pressure's just too great.  you're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  all of them.  you go in the door.  i..."i got to close this fucker, or i don't eat lunch," "or i don't win the cadillac..." we fuckin' work too hard.  you work too hard.  we all, i remember when we were at platt...huh?  glen ross farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
you had one you'd know it.  patel. they keep coming up.  i don't know. they like to talk to salesmen.  they're lonely, something.  they like to feel superior, i don't know.  never bought a fucking thing. you're sitting down "the rio rancho this, the blah blah blah," "the mountain view--" "oh yes.  my brother told me that..." they got a grapevine.  fuckin' indians, george. not my cup of tea.  speaking of which i want to tell you something:  i never got a cup of tea with them. you see them in the restaurants.  a supercilious race.  what is this look on their face all the time?  i don't know.  i don't know.  their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, i don't know.  i don't know.  i don't like it. christ...
i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm fucked on the board.  you.  you see how...i...  i can't...my mind must be in other places. 'cause i can't do any...
i'm going to the chinks.  you're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
i'm going to have your job, shithead. i'm going downtown and talk to mitch and murrray, and i'm going to lemkin.  i don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  you're going out, i swear to you, you're going...
oh, fuck.  fuck.  fuck fuck fuck!  williamson!!! williamson!!!  open the fucking...williamson...
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then i don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  you be as cold as you want. a child would know it, he's right.  you're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
why should the sale not stick? hey, fuck you.  that's what i'm saying.  you have no idea of your job.  a man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  you hear what i'm saying to you?  your "end of month board..." you can't run an office. i don't care.  you don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  you ever been on a sit?  ever?  has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
i've seen those leads.  i saw them when i was at homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers rio rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  they couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  they're broke, john. they're cold.  they're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  even so. even so.  alright.  fine.  fine. even so.  i go in, four fucking leads they got their money in a sock.  they're fucking polacks, john.  four leads.  i close two. two.  fifty per...

let me tell you something, shelly. i do what i'm hired to do. i'm...wait a second.  i'm hired to watch the leads.  i'm given...hold on, i'm given a policy.  my job is to do that.  what i'm told.  that's it.  you, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark i'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  what the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  fuck marshaling the leads.  what the fuck talk is that? what the fuck talk is that?  where did you learn that?  in school?  that's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." our job is to sell.  i'm the man to sell.  i'm getting garbage.  you're giving it to me, and what i'm saying is it's fucked.
lately kiss my ass lately.  that isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to murray.  talk to mitch. when we were on peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  you talk to him.  the seville...?  he came in, "you bought that for me shelly." out of what?  cold calling.  nothing. sixty-five, when we were there, with glen ross farms?  you call 'em downtown.  what was that?  luck? that was "luck"?  bullshit, john. you're burning my ass, i can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  my stats for those years? bullshit...over that period of time...?  bullshit.  it wasn't luck. it was skill.  you want to throw that away, john...?  you want to throw that away?
shut the fuck up.  ricky.  you have a mean streak in you...  and what the fuck are you babbling about...?
hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...this whole goddamn...
well, you want to swing by the chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
and, and, and, i did it.  and i put a kid through school. she...and...cold calling, fella. door to door.  but you don't know. you don't know.  you never heard of a streak.  you never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." what are you, you're a secretary, john.  fuck you.  that's my message for you.  fuck you and kiss my ass. you don't like it, i'll go talk to jerry graff.  period.  fuck you. put me on the board.  and i want three worthwhile leads today and i don't want any bullshit about them and i want 'em close together 'cause i'm going to hit them all today.  that's all i have to say to you.
you bet your ass.  who wants to go to lunch?  who wants to go to lunch? i'm buying.  eighty-two fucking grand.  and twelve grand in commission.  john.  on fucking deadbeat magazine subscription leads.
get the chalk.  get the chalk...get the chalk!  i closed 'em!  i closed the cocksucker.  get the chalk and put me on the board.  i'm going to hawaii!  put me on the cadillac board, williamson!  pick up the fuckin' chalk.  eight units. mountain view...
or a piss...?  a great meal fades in reflection.  everything else gains.  you know why? 'cause it's only food.  this shit we eat, it keeps us going.  but it's only food. the great fucks that you may have had.  what do you remember about them?
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  it gets so you don't mind it.  that's the worst thing that i can confess.  you know how long it took me to get there? a long time.  when you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  you think you're queer...? i'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  you think that you're a thief?  so what?  you get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  get shut of it.  shut it out.  you cheated on your wife...?  you did it, live with it.  you fuck little girls, so be it. there's an absolute morality?  may be.  and then what?  if you think there is, then be that thing.  bad people go to hell?  i don't think so.  if you think that, act that way.  a hell exists on earth?  yes. i won't live in it.  that's me. you ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
i'll show you how to chew it." your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
"fuck the machine"? "fuck the machine"?  what is this.  courtesy class...?  you're fucked, rick--are you fucking nuts?  you're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  you want to...
patel?  fuck you.  fuckin' shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.  and vishnu, too.  into the bargain.  fuck that, john.  you know your business, i know mine. your business is being an asshole, and i find out whose fucking cousin you are, i'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--i'll wait for the new leads.
gotta check up on my boys.  hey, what's with the food?  some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'canapes,' he says.  i say, 'can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or i'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
what kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  he knows his father killed his uncle carlo.  he heard connie.
the high court of israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned jew.' his passport's been invalidated except for return to the u.s.  he landed in buenos aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  they turned him down.
you give your loyalty to a jew over your own blood.
how can you be fair with animals? they recruit niggers and spicks they do violence in their own grandmother's neighborhoods.  and everything is dope and whores the gambling is left to last.  let me run my family without you on my back.  i want them taken care of.
the rosatos are running crazy taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the jew in miami.
i'm going to squeeze you, corleone, because i don't like you i don't like the kind of man you are.  i despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
what are you then?  what will you be ten years from now?  still cutting lawns?  still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
we're watching the movie, harry. you got that!  we are watching my fucking movie.
sorry.  my pajamas are tailored. would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  no more immodest than a kilt, you know.
you must think the whole world is queer.  well it's not.  war sure isn't.
the fucking studio butchered it. it was 1937, hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the new york bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  anything to avoid losing the german market.  they cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. the picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  for which i was blamed.
the world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  a man has to make up his own life, alone.
grow up. you don't kill people like me. people like me die in their sleep at 87 ... do you know why? because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over california ...
i'm not going to get fucked like gribbs. he's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  i don't need that. i don't care who it is. i'm warning everybody. gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. that's not going to happen to me.  you understand?
are you nuts?  jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. let me tell you. nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. they do stuff with the wrong people. they don't have things organized. you know who goes to jail? nigger stickup men. that's who. and they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? you're going to fuck up everything?
guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. just then there's this fuckin' boom like fifty yards down the road. some guy's car hit a tree.
two weeks? that's nothin'. my uncle marty? will knows him. that guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! one night he was drivin' back to his house on i-93-- statie pulls him over.
fuck you, you fat fuck.
look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' patriots' games and still workin' construction, i'll fuckin' kill you. and that's not a threat, that's a fact. i'll fuckin' kill you.
i don't know what the fuck you're doin'. you're givin' us a ride.
i don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  you'd prob'ly fit right in.
the fuckin' trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. the fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
yeah, he was probably drunker than my uncle, who fuckin' knows? so the cop goes "stay here" and he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. so, my uncle marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. so he goes, "fuck it." he gets in his car and drives home.
would you shut the fuck up! i know what you ordered, i was there!
--you know how fuckin' easy this is to me? this is a joke!  and i'm sorry you can't do this. i really am. 'cause if you could i wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
i teach this shit, i didn't say i knew how to do it.
they use' to be a sayin': a chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. an' another: born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. that's the way i always heard it.
well, i'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! grampa took up this land seventy years ago. my pa was born here. we was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. and that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! so just come on and try to push me off!
ahhh... it's all fucked up. nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. one day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
a jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? you're insane.
that's a tragedy. can i finish my story please? i began my search for meaning. i was a catholic, jew, scientologist, sufi, buddhist. i went to a psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. and they all pretty much say the same stuff.
you're fucking psycho.
yeah-- after i shoot you through the fucking forehead i'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
-look. you want to kill a good guy, but not be a bad guy, you wait until a bad guy kills the good guy, and then you come in and kill the bad guy, and then you're the good guy.
his assistant. he acted like marlin's son, only he wasn't. at least they never said he was... i bet they were lovers, faggots. yes, gay lovers. wild kingdom my ass!
i've called liz. they can set me up with a trailer for pilgrim. i thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
what are you, stoned or stupid? you don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the fbi. where are your brains, in your ass? don't you know anything?
but why?  we raised you as a jew.
could i get a <u>drink</u>,  n'i don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for i'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with the dirty dozen, one <u>hispanic</u>, one <u>librarian</u>, one <u>jew</u>, and one from column a, and one from column...  thank you.
i'm going to cut you loose.  with all due respect, doctor, if you fuck with me, i'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  do right and you'll live through this.
it's a <u>joke</u>.  you're a joke.  you're a joke.  you don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  that is the fine limit of your ambitions...
welcome to the human race.  do you know, there are people who admire you?  reasonable people.  why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
but... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  i used it.  to <u>bargain</u>.  for her <u>sympathy</u>...  i <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"--
stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
because i can be! the same fucking cheek, goddamnit! why are you pulling my dick? do you think, do you really think, if betty finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? no way! uh-uh!
you're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in u.s. fucking a today. that's got to be the least private thing i can think of.
phase my ass! you'll be <u>back</u>! i'm storming normandy beaches and you're running in place with pauline fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. have to stay tough! you'll be back.
don't be a dick. that stuff'll kill her.
hey ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a no fags allowed rule?
i'm not saying i hate sick people or anything but i hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what i mean.  there <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  i probably woulda vomited on him.
out!  i toldja.  jesus christ, i got customers waiting!  an' you were gonna go out like that?  an' meet the public in stocking-fucking-feet?
listen, gale, i know you're emotionally involved.  don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  no, gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  you are a goddamn cream puff!  try and be a hard-ass!
fuck guessing.  you keep your mouth shut.
<u>fuck</u> them!  now get your head in the game, phil--we have to handle this.
you can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
that money's fucked up your brain. talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
we're fucked until we think of a way out then we're rich.
we're fucked.
i got these people!  you try to come get me, i'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
fuck that.  they're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
<u>i don't know</u>.  talley talked those punks into letting smith out.  he's fucking us over, glen.  that guy is fucking us over.
i have your fucking family.  don't forget that.
those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  he <u>kills</u> people!
i'll go in that fuckin' house right now! i'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> fbi, you cocksuckingmotherfucker!!  and i've got <u>smith</u>!  <u>i've got smith</u>!!
you dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
you're fucking black! you're not even a nigger, you're african!  they're not staying to stop this thing. they're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
don't bullshit me, paul. you're the smartest man here. you have them all eating out of your hand. you'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
you know how happy i'd be if that was really true, evelyn? and how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
i guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. well, congratu-fucking-lations, steven: round one, you win.
hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  you know that.  it was my fault, babe, it really was.  and you know i'm sorry. and i'm sorry to see you upset now.  i hate to see you in pain like this.
don't say it, hawkins.  i'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
the auction house, asshole.  one night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  no checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. it's a great deal, i can't lie.
you can't, convict!  you're just a shmoe!  every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  it rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "how could this happen to me?"  it's a natural inclination.  but for i, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! you are on my planet!  you walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  the lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to me!
i can't believe this.  i'm in fucking russia, or do i have to say, the fucking soviet union and i'm shooting a non-bolshevick.  i never thought i'd say "i'm just in this job for the money."  sad. any last immature quips?
ben, i'm going to florida. i hate thanksgiving and i hate the cold. i have a new nurse. she's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and i've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
man, francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes i do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
stupid!  is wendy hood your girlfriend?
yes. kill me. kill me like you promised -
don't worry. he was white trash, they come at two a penny. i dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
what can i do to put you at ease? shall we begin like david copperfield? i am born, i grow up. or shall we begin when i was born to darkness, as i call it. that's really where we should start, don't you think?
she was born before your wife returned here to die. you never knew.
you've never been born. you don't exist. you haven't a care in the world.
...everybody wants the job.  no one wants the authority. except hendricks.  fine.  he can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  call me in new york...tell him to kiss my ass....
lunch for whitey.  something to munch on in case things get dicey.
a shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  you know how many are born?  maybe five. they eat each other before birth! they're born killers!
you guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... it's just a shark.  a great big bloody wonderful shark.  don't say anything to anyone. the locals find out they'll panic. they'll want to kill it.  we've got us a great white, michael. we're going to do us some real research....
don't give me that! <u>not another</u> <u>word</u>! when you had the fat lady in there, and i asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. so as far as i was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. and if the king of fucking england had walked in & told me different, i wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
you're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. you're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. not many people could do that in a place like this .. and you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. i mean, stop me if i'm going up the wrong nostril ..
you gotta stop calling los angeles .. you're dragging l.a. around with you like an addiction.  look at the shit you're putting yourself through? for what? for <u>nothing</u>, i know it, i been there. remember me? up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  if there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. let somebody else worry about it. you gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
john, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. the case is on its ass, you're closed.  c'mon, let it go for once .. have a drink. c'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
no you don't. that's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. that's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. you won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
don't you know nothing about this guy? he <u>reads</u> the newspapers. col- lects the cuttings. when are they gonna find her? now he's reading helena robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. you couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
the man who killed amber is a psychopath. he was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and i didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason i want you to stay at margie's - coz i can't protect you here ..
no, c'mon, freddy, let's have this out & over. you know what everyone thinks? they think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. and no one's blaming you for it, i hear she's worth the flowers. but don't come in here get- ting holy over us. sure i put it in the paper. coz i wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. i don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
he tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." well, give me a fucking break! there <u>is</u> no "ser- ial killer." stick her name up in neon, there's still no serial kil- ler! and i ain't the only one say- ing it. everyone in this building is saying it. and i mean <u>everyone</u>.
everything's on the fucking run! everything --
well, boo-fucking-hoo.
it's called self-testing.  but in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  a uniquely human characteristic.  in fact, human beings destroy things so well that i sometimes think that's our function. maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
we'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  i'm almost done.  damn it, i need another adhesive, something pliable i can --
none of that matters.  our communications equipment's been destroyed.  if your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and i'm guessing by the look on his face --
oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
shit. we're still putting the victim list together. you'll need a forklift for the case file. i suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  you're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in american history.
look. i almost killed my -- i almost killed someone.
all right, yes, i had been. those sick, wild letters -- i'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. well, they said, all right that's grunemann. so try to remember when you and he - when -- well i don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  dumpers they get their kicks beating you up. a man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean another month with the bull-dykes.
but if cable killed grunemann why would he get you hired to look for grunemann?
look, ted, i'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  three marriages, two divorces...you're gonna be okay.
<u>no</u>, <u>i</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  the crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. but it was all... it was a mistake.
<u>no</u>.  if you don't kill him instantly, i'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  and even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
<u>so</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>hector</u>.
<u>i</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>maine</u>.  that's ridiculous.
raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. and lecter knows him. maybe even treated him... you think so, too, don't you? or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  it doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
"routine," my ass!  ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
no way, mister beck!  <u>no</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  we just did a full shift, you can't call shack duty on top of a full shift.  it's a contract violation!
fucking great...you telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
antiques? what the fuck do we know about antiques? we rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?

range? i don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but i don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. i want to look fucking mean.
jews don't celebrate christmas, tom.

if you will order stuff that comes from kat-man-fucking-du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ never mind that, what about the money?
i mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what i mean, willy.
jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. people breed like chickens.
my father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
my government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. i'm talking about people here--men. mi amigo eladio cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. i loan a little money out, settle some arguments. got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. there's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the mexicans hire each other. there's the holiness church and there's big o's place.
another fucking magician. jesus.
i should have been honest with you, right from the start.  i wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  i was born to murder the world.
when they're born its like vietnam. it's terrifying.
he couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  peter, what time were you born?
you're about to become the anti-christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
last night a guy named john townsend tried to shoot me and now i find out you knew him.  what the fuck is going on?
mother killed the father, then killed herself.  crime of passion.
shut it.  shut yer fuckin' mouth.
jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
you fuckin' don't do that. you don't do it, you cocksucker. i'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
you don't how fuckin' stupid i am.
ok.  i'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just shut the fuck up, try to listen and learn --
presence - with a double ass meaning gifts i bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause i throw what i know with a resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
leave this one to the detectives, they ain't gonna solve shit, i can help you, make you the man with a plan, give you the gift that i flow -- think fast -- you wanna know who killed that guy?
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and i don't know if they're going down -- i can't see inside his mouth anymore -- i'm up all night staring at him and i don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
i just, i just -- i just -- i'm just in a fucking state, i know he's going and it's like i don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- what the fuck do i do with his body? what happens when he dies? that next moment: what? what do i do?  then what?
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
this is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
....i dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
-- that's right, that's right, and what i'm saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  that there is no need for insight or understanding.  things of the past! gone, over, done. do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? how fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  i'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  god damn i'm good.  there is no need for insight.  there is no need for understanding.  i have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  the "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: not a trance, mind you, but a state. a state that is brand new.  the system's state. what did i do?  i realized that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. i'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  i'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
i wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: my enrollment was totally unoffical because i was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  but there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: macready, horn and langtree among others. i was completely independent financially, and like i said: one sad sack a shit. so what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and i think that's what most people respond to in "seduce," and at the end of the day? hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding what you can be in this world.  defining it.  controling it and saying: i will take what is mine.  you just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
-- that you shouldn't have done? that you regret, what? this? what's this? fuck, man, c'mon.  treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
now you must really shut the fuck up, please. shut the fuck up.
shut the fuck up. shut the fuck up.
this is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- i don't know. i don't know -- can you give me nothing? you have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- i don't want any money, i couldn't live with myself, this thing i've done -- i've fucking done so many bad things -- i fucked around.  i fucked around on him, i fucking cheated on him, alan. you're his lawyer, our laywer, there, i'm his wife, we are married. i broke the conract of marriage, i fucking cheated on him, many times over, i sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... other things i've done..

something feels wrong. i think someone's fucking with me. trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
he's got to have a car, right? we just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
fuck you i gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. you lie		   * to yourself! you don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. so you			  * make up your own truth.						 *

look, miss. i know you're still upset about that incident in chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. we don't have time to play nursemaid to every single tom dick and harry.
the bees killed thomas j, and i killed my mother.
i was born jaundiced. once i sat on a toilet seat at a truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. and i've learned to live with this chicken bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so i knew dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  dad, i don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. it can only mean one thing.  cancer.  i'm dying.
harry, i'm serious, trust me harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every tom dick and harry.
have you sized up the groomsmen, jules?  as m. of h., you get first fuck.  don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. and since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
just save your breath, wayne. we hate you. if anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
please explain to me, mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old danny millhouse's blown off head? where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and mallory? what's so fucking pure about that?

longer we hang around down here, jack, better chance there is either glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
sign says "shut the fuck up."  or can't you guys read?
what about <i>my</i> motive?  now i can say i fucked a us marshal.  you think i will?
how, dick?  the way <u>you</u> earned it?  by marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  what is this knute rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  you were a goddamn dumpling.  maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  till you <u>were</u> nothing.  i saved your ass.  so you'll pardon me if i don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  okay, dick?  i can't do it.
listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. they're fucking animals.
watch the road, boy.  i like this town car.  we can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
like a fag.
white boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
then, what <u>are</u> we, drew?! the <u>winners</u>? "ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of aids goes to andrew beckett and his lover miguel..." excuse me, i'm not your lover. i'm your care partner. fuck!
let me tell you something, okay? when you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where i was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. as a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. and that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
okay... they want you out. it's against the law to fire you for having aids, so they make you look like a fuck up. which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
i'd heard of <u>something</u>. the gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
okay, so... help me with this one, joe... is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
lisa, c'mon. one guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? it's disgusting.
and the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... i can't <u>stand</u> that shit. now i'm being totally honest with you.
by god you <u>will</u> settle it! if you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... now, joseph. what would you require to settle this matter today?
bob. i must ask you to shut the fuck up. did andrew beckett say "i might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" he said nothing. and now, andrew beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, philadelphia, judicial establishment. my god.
i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
<u>you</u> made it a problem when you let owens die like that. when you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
<u>get the fucking cells over here</u>, johns. what's the discussion?
and there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>that's</u> how they train you! on a fucking simulator!
i'm born-again.
i know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.

don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. out here you belong to me. now move.
barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  third platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when third platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. we'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. it'll be a massacre!
you're dead, you're fucking dead elias!
shit. get your boots on martin, next time i catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet i'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
say i can dig it. smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
you guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a heaven - and god, i hope so - i know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause his pains he done left down here. baaaaaaaaa!
how the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
baaaa! fuck it, they sold us out - so what! what'd you'all expect? civilian life is phoney bullshit man. they're robots man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. that's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. cause it don't really matter. don't mean shit. so what! whatcha want - a parade! fuck that too! no war time no grunt never got no respect. till he was dead - and even then! you're fighting for yourself man! you're fighting for your soul, dat's all. remember dat. and it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...love and hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
yes.  yours.  you haven't murdered anybody.  you killed mitchell. wasn't that an accident?  it must have been.  if you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  that's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, i get hired not to work.  nice girl you were with last night. known her long?
you watch your fucking mouth!  mr. hoover himself pinned the seal of honor right here!
you tell me the fucking truth johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  did they?!
we found 'em both, dead. and the gear from the chopper. if they're central american, i'm a fuckin' chinaman. by the looks of 'em, i'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are cia.  another thing, major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are russians, military advisors by the look of it. something big was about to happen here.
i've never treated you like a whore.
i know.  hey, don't mind me.  i'm being stupid.  i'll think about it, okay?  it's a real good offer for a whore.
all this because of that whore!
viv... don't be stupid.  we're whores.
don't worry.  i'll pay for it. what a you charge?  huh?  twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  are you a fifty dollar whore?
i bet.  a lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
you seem a decent fellow. i hate to kill you.
well, i... well, it's just that... i'm sorry i called you fat, fat, fat.
here.  buy bullets.  kill.  kill them all!
it may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
sure--they're sorta queer, i'd say. they's lots of queer goings on up there. they even brought a dog back to life once.
you're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. he also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over washington. d.c.
rose, darlin', you break my heart. but i am only a human man myself of the father variety. rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
that's correct -- outside it, not in it. as for the job, well, the jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  but i can build anything, buddy. give me the plans and i can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. it's a fact, i can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
oh, it's all right, beats jew york. but the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
this scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  you think we're gonna let zimmermann haul it onto <u>our</u> streets on the fourth-of-fucking-july!?
i'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
there was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
you think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? fuck you!   this is meaningless! you'll never win!  you know, as soon as i'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
they either say, 'kill the nigger' or 'hope you die, honky.' -- what ya got in the bag?
yo, a bad reputation -- twenty years from now people will say 'd'you remember marie?' 'no, who was she?' 'she was that little whore who hung out at the atomic hoagie shop.' 'oh, now i remember!'... see, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
that doesn't matter -- you don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
okay, you've seen me.  now give me a towel.
as my american friend larry would say: are you fucking deaf?  it's under your seat.
it means i was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  you've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, i might note.  there's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
i know i don't have to, sam, it's just that, for once, i want to.  when i was a -  patriot, it was a given i'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  you know: any man who needed setting up.  sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  sometimes so i could kill him myself. ira isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, sam.  to most of the men i with i was always the girl.  "send the girl to do it."  "tell the girl to take care of it."  "have the girl fuck him."  but i look at you and i get this feeling you take me for what i am: no more, no less.
he'll kill me anway, sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
go ahead, shoot... shoot and kill the bitch, i don't care.  and yet you don't shoot.  interesting. put down your weapon and walk away.
that fucking figures...
he's a cop, vincent, he's french and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
you're a cop...you're a fucking cop...i should kill you.
i never really thought i was part of the world you move in, sam, to tell you the truth.  i'm a hood, a thief.  big time in a small time king of way.  to the local police i'm a prize, to the local hoods i'm a legend.  but to a guy like you i'm just another two bit hired gun.
he killed her...he killed her...
you're thinking about killing him. i can't do that.  no way.  i've never killed a man.  never even shot at one.
you're thinking about killing him.  i can't do that.  no way.  i've never killed a man.  never even shot at one...
i'm about to be killed and you "shhh" me!  this wasn't my case, lee.  ricky tan didn't kill my father, the fu-cang long are not in south central.  i didn't have to help you.
well don't do that.  polite don't work here.  you do that polite shit here in america, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
he was born fighting. and born hungry.
good. i fucking hate australians.
i don't buy that. there's a place for hatred.  did you know that liz and i got into an argument the night she was killed? i acted like an ass and i never had a chance to apologize to her.  do you know what that feels like?
i deal in u.s. pounds, friend. none of that faggot metric crap for me.
this chink have a name?
we're coordinating with palmdale p.d.. we'll have your sorry ass covered.
danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember domingo, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
no, you can't taste it.  it's the fucking lab! now shut up.
respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  sir.
in the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch hudson with a big ole' trailer.
i am, but i like imported whiskey. so there i am and i hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. that ole' boy comes right out of the brush, i got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. i aim, i got my finger tight on the trigger and then i just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  then i sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
me?  i'm walking with my hound, lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  i got me a flask of pure kentucky mash whiskey...
you shut up, this is the most fucked up mission i ever heard of.  goddamned ryan, fuck the little bastard.
a fucking mess, two maybe three kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  command says we hold st. mere, but north of that, it's all krauts.  even if ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
yes, sir, as a final note, i'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of france and while we're at it, fuck private james ryan.
easy for you to say, sir.  fucking james ryan, i'd like to wring his fucking neck.
captain, i gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear.
do you have any idea what's involved? the paperwork alone?  forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  then the engineers show up.  they stand around and they argue about drainage - i'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, i've been through it, i know.
jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
jews, yeah.  investors.
it's got nothing to do with reality, oskar, i know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  it's got a ritual significance to them, jews shoveling snow.
we're going to bring her in. hide her out for a coupla days. and we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. no one is allowed out after dark.
37 usages of himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 tatum's, 47 riley's. and that's just on campus. it's hopeless.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
no. i will not crawl under a rock. this is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. i'll just get used to it.
i swear to god if you lay a finger on her i'll fucking kill you!
here's how i see it.  i've got no house, no movie, no gun, and i'm being stalked.  because someone wants to kill me?  no, because someone wants to kill you. so now, starting now, i go where you go.  that way, if someone wants to kill me, i'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  make sense?
really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in roman polanski's latest picture. huh, what a coincide i was picked up by roman bridger. well, not exactly the roman i wanted. get my point? stab 3 is bullshit. fuck, because of your big mouth i'm here, drinking piss water scotch with second rate fucking celebrities like jennifer jollie and yourself!  hey, i just got an idea. maybe i should have a look at your break line. that your car over there?
roman knock it off! do you people even know why you kill people? you kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
has there been another goddamn rewrite? how  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
if you lay a hand on him i'll fucking kill you!
uh-huh i'm sure. i've killed someone! oh my god i've actually killed someone!
and it fucked her up royally. think about it. it makes perfect sense. her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's god, etc. completely suicidal. and one day she snaps. she wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. teachers, students, staff, janitors...
and not just killed, sid. we're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
"what sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. what fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world.  not knowing that we are nothing.  we are not what was intended."
we're screwed.  he's fucking with us.
you have a strange way about you... i mean interesting.  i'm sorry.  it's really none of my business.  it's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  if david saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  that's how he is.
you lie! all white men lie...and kill...
i think i've killed him.  martin, my husband, i've killed him!  that is, i'm not sure, but...
i have. and chinks to show for it.
family? family? friends? drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, david.
beverly hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
what would my being a faggot have to do with that?
well, are you? are you queer?
if you screw me up for tonight, i'll kill you, i swear to god, i'll kill you.
no, man, no. you can say everybody's a whore. she's okay. i mean jackie'll fuck around but not that much. somewhere she really likes you, lester, and it's not just the bread. she's okay.
just a whore, i go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. i'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
she's nothing but a whore.
we're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. it just happened. felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to pta meetings?
... how am i gonna tell you what they have against you? i mean jesus fucking christ, they're women, aren't they? have you ever listened to women talk, man? have you? well i do, i do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. i'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? being fucked up by some guy. that's all that's on their minds. i'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? all women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. they fucking hate us! don't you know that?
no, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. it's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am i right or am i right?
all right, forget this filth. continue about your friend.
a nigger cook.
a nigger!
a nigger.
holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-jesus-christ!
it isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady. now he's got them to cancel the fair.
this whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  but... i am not going to kill you.  not me...
no one will believe your lies, whore.
ain't that the sweetest thing. what am i supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
that ain't none of your damn bidness. besides that's the way friends do one another. fuck it, i'm gonna go call 'em. honey, find my guitar, i think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
i'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! you mind your own business. now get out! now, before i get too mad to turn back.
we don't have a goddamn band! y'all just shut the fuck up! we don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. am i the only one sane human bein' around here? just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, i guess.
karl childers just in from the state facility. make one of them gruntin' sounds karl or whatever it is you do.  oh well, karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell i'm talkin' about. and to vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. now that takes balls. our number one tune for the folks, boys. kick it off johnson!
my daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. i went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. hit was bloody-like around that towel. hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
she says it's for the times when he's good to her. she's lonely since daddy died. she said sometimes she don't know why.  he threatened to kill her if she ever left him. my daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. vaughan, he's real good to mama. vaughan that you met. but he's not able to do anything to doyle, he's funny you know. not funny ha, ha, funny queer. he likes to go with men instead of women. that makes him not to be able to fight too good. he sure is nice though. he's from st. louis. people who are queer can get along better in a big town. he got transferred here to work. but mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. for bein' the way he is. i wish he liked to go with women. i'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than doyle.
not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
nothing much. he said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  fucking kids, huh? they take you for granted every time.
i try not to, anyway. it's better for your health. i mean, look at you, vincent. you're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on long island. you're the guy with the white shoes and the white caddy and the white shag carpet. but you've had two heart attacks, and i'm still waiting for my first.
not a one. not one customer all day. i bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, i'm going straight down the skids. what do i want to be hiring someone for? i can't even pay my own wages.
an abortion, stupid.  i had an abortion the day before yesterday. so you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  bye-bye, baby!
i don't got no daddy, you dig? i got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
i don't know, tommy. you think anyone gives a rat's ass about kuwait? i read something about the head sheik over there. he marries a different virgin every friday and then divorces her on monday. you think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
you'll do it, all right. you fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. that's how it works, buster. if you don't do it, i'm going to throw you out of here. do you understand me? if you don't pay auggie what you owe him. i'm finished with you.
it might not be far, but it's another galaxy. black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
but back in '34, japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  so...?
they're not his neighbor, like you are.  he is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. the same as you.
you got it.  it's six dollars a man.  be on the campus in urbana at eight o'clock -
you know, me and stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
'cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. i fucking hate it.
yeah,  <b>shut your fucking face, unclefucka!!</b>
you get me cheesy poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and i'll watch my fucking mouth!
dude, anybody who doesn't think terrance and phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
you're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
<b>shut your fucking face!! unclefucka!!! you're the one that fucked your uncle, unclefucka!!! you don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn you just fuck your uncle all day long!</b>
<b>shut your fucking face, unclefucka!! you're an asslicking, ball sucking unclefucka!! you're an unclefucka, yes it's true nobody fucks uncles quite like you-</b>
you'd fuck your uncle!
you'd fuck your uncle!
now do what i say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
you tried to make it look like junior trashed his place. junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
i hate fuckin' opera.
i was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. i swear man, the guy thought i was a piata. if nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. he woulda killed me. fuckin' guy man, just snapped. how do you like your burger?
he killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! sid and breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's murmur increases. kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
i killed him once, i'll just have to kill him again.
i did your dirty work for you sheila, now fuck off. theo drives away leaving sheila standing alone. she watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
it. bouncy-bouncy. fucked. he tried to squeeze my fucking head off. what did you say to him? when they reach each other, they stop. sheila seems to weigh her answer.
are you fucking with me sheila? is something gonna happen to buzz? sheila seems to be trying to tell theo, but is unable.
your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. my dad is slime. kastle walks over. theo stands up and shakes kastle's proffered hand.
you're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  can't you tell us something.
no, it isn't.  your name is norman. but your younger brother -- what was his name?  the one who was stung when you were younger.  the one that died. the one you couldn't save.  what was his name?  "mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "but i don't want to go swimming, norman.  i'm scared." "c'mon, <u>harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  you heartless fuck.  that's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
you don't remember you did.  but i'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry, don't you?  you remember that.
everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  if it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
it's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
dizzy wouldn't want our tears. she'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. so go out and kill a bug for dizzy. kill as many as you can. you are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
why, you <u>whore</u>!
i'm somewhere in the, i'm on location, eh:  this...well i'm going to solve it here, or this <u>bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in akron, i'm talking about restraint of trade, breach of...it's very simple...!
alright.  let's...  page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  you know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  it could be his...
fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
<u>fuck</u> the traffic light.  i'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a major motion picture...
well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and i'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   and the best to marion...  where have <u>you</u> been?
like dykes and dogs.
every time i'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
the guy <u>i</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>prep</u> school, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
now is that little prick still here, because if he is, i'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
shut the fuck up.  <u>i</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
you taught my child that i am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
you put filth in my child's mouth.
somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  he <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  how he was born a magician.
as you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  they don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
well, he did. with his family. but his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. and if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. so in my book he's a survivor.
don't screw around with me. you know what i'm talking about.  you're taking those sats. you're taking those sats or your cd collection is history. you're taking those sats and you're going to college. you're taking those sats if i have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
nigger, fuck me hard!!!...
nigger, fuck me hard!!...
nigger, fuck me hard!
say, 'nigger, fuck me hard!'
nigger.
say, 'nigger.'
naturally.  it would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  but this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
no, major, i don't.  they have no regard for human life.  they wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
but war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
you know, like, like, i would always think, uh, you know, what if i make the wrong move? but maybe there isn't any right move. you know? i mean, look at us. you know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same tv. nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" and see, that's what makes me freak. because i can do anything i want, as long as i don't care about the result.
you should get upset. everyone should get upset. when, when hitler was greasing the jews, people were saying, "don't get me upset. your bumming me out." my duty as a human being is to be pissed off. jesus christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. nothing ever changes, man. fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. and then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. it's all so fucking futile.
i don't think i like that guy's attitude at all. hey, you know what? take off the blades. i mean it. i'm gonna break your fucking legs. take 'em off.
you stand someplace else, man. you stand someplace else. this is our corner. you don't fucking own it!
you know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? but, like, you know, have it set in here. you know, like, like, like, with her and shit. you know, like, you know, like, "closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
so you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? well, here we are, what do you think? pretty fucking pathetic huh? kind of like one of those documentaries on educational tv?
they never hurt me? they hurt me every day with their attitude. you know, like they even have a right. who the fuck do they think they are? let me tell you something, i was born here. alright? i'm an american. and i'm owed something. look, they took it from me.
oh no, no. you know what? fuck that. no, you lied to me. you lied to me because you're gutless. you're a gutless, drunken looser.
well, i, you know, i took her to the van, you know. it was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? and she started crying, "tim, tim, what's the matter? i love you. don't go!" and i was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and i was filled with disgust, man. and i fuckin'... oh, man, i really...
well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what i mean? fuck. so they'll talk and talk. they'll probably talk all night. and, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? but, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. by six a.m. he's parking the pink cadillac. fuck. there's really only one answer.
to women. they're all whores. let us not forget what chenowsky said. "the greatest men are the most alone." and without suffering, jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
i mean, you know, at least i admit that i don't know. i know that things are fucked up beyond belief and i know that i have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? i don't have an answer. i don't have a fucking message.
what? what the fuck do you know about the third world? you been there? no? no, well, i have. fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. everything stinks. it's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. no nothing. the assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
the road's hell, you know? i mean airport, hotel, show. and airport, hotel, show. airport, hotel, show. i mean, fuck, man, you know? you still living at your mom's?
hey it's your roof. it's your fucking problem.  hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the circle a on first street, yeah, okay.  you're fucked now, pal!  um, send an ambulance 'cause i, i think it's an overdose or something. okay. okay.  jeff, they're coming. just wait here. i'm gonna go over to scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
you know what? go ahead and shoot me. go ahead! fucking shoot me! come on! come on, man! come on!
why? what are you gonna do? huh? you're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
nobody's fucking anybody!
okay. you know what? watch your fucking language, alright? or i might have to.
buff is funny, okay? she likes buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
yeah. yeah, i'm jealous of mtv faggots who are named after animals.
make a move. greasecake. towel-head.
oh for chrissakes...  "white trash betty."  i didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered safeway.
you have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  shit - i forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
look, you're fat, diane.  you're fat, fat, fat!  because you eat, eat, eat!  what?!  she keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
don't martha-fucking-stewart me!  if you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
i-i didn't mean to say "whore," diane. i just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
'cause i will jerry springer you faster than you can say "fat-assed lesbian!"
wait a minute.  you watched the apple fucking-dumpling gang?!
i don't care anyway.  i want the coffin to be white.  and i want it specially lined with satin. white, or deep pink.
can't have you moping around the campus. why don't you come home with us for dinner?
sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  i know my wife packed one in there...
yeah.  right.  how were you supposed to know? fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  colt, browning, smith, thompson, kalashnikov... all men.  men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  you're so creative.  you don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  to feel it growing inside you.  all you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
you're already dead, silberman.  everybody here dies.  you know i believe that.  so don't fuck with me!
uh huh, great.  then those fat fucks in washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
you think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
yes, i'm a jew. but i like to think first i'm a human being.
david, i don't understand a thing about you. you're a jew. are you a jew?
duty? i am sorry, duty? duty fucking duty. trouble is, you americans want everybody to live like you. we liberated berlin, major steve, not you. our duty also is to bring back the best of german culture.
i was in vienna. i had with me an austrian chauffeur, max his name was, he spent time in the camps. we were looking at these viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. i said, 'to think a million of these people came out to welcome adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  and max said, 'oh, not these people, major. these people were all at home hiding jews in their attics.' you get the point, colonel? the point is they're all full of shit.
if he had no idea, why did the jews need saving? this is the question, emmi, to all germans: why did the jews need saving in this country? why, if people had no idea?
have you ever smelled burning flesh? i smelt it four miles away. four miles away, i smelt it. have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? you talk to me about culture, art and music? you putting that in the scales, wilhelm? you setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? they had orchestras in the camps. they played beethoven, wagner. the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. i don't understand the germans' relationship with music. what do you need music for? your pals you could call to save a few jews when millions of them were being annihilated? yes, i blame you for not getting hanged, i blame you for your cowardice. you strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and i say to you, lies!
everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the jews. but--  i have things here you said and wrote. listen to this: 'the jew composer schonberg is admired by the jewish international.' and what about this: 'jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' you deny you said these things?
yes, a despicable human being. he was in the ministry of culture. his job was to get rid of jews in the arts.
they were jews, they had to leave. they were right to leave.  i could not leave my country in her deepest misery. after all, i am a german.  i... i stayed in my homeland. is that my sin in your eyes?
let me me help you, then. you picked up the phone and made a call -  'hello, adolf? wilhelm speaking. listen, old pal, there's a jew-boy musician i want you to help. he needs a permit to get to paris.'
i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape. how did you do that?
yes. a corporal. us army. a jew. he said he'd seen the telegram in the chancellery.
goebbels, yes, josef goebbels said, 'there's not a single filthy jew left in germany on whose behalf dr. furtwngler has not intervened.' no, no one could have been less of a nazi than dr. furtwngler.
dr. furtwngler is a great musician. he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape.
white light.  pain.  like being ripped inside out... slowly.  like being born, maybe.
no!  you take another step, i'll shoot!  they're trying to kill me...
they fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  and then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
what whistle?  there's no fucking whistle.  this is fucking dangerous.
this is un-fucking professional.
they look a right load of wallies. patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' household cavalry.  watch it.
valentine wasn't even there.  if he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  but i'll tell you something.  she stood in front of these dudes, man.  eyeballing <u>them</u>.  checking <u>them</u> out.  i felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
you sound like my fucking probation officer.
-- they want southern, i do southern, they want midwest, i do midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, i'm shit out of luck.  one thing i can't do is english. americans can't.  shouldn't even try. and laurence olivier couldn't do us.
while they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
"he ain't wrong."  listen, i know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. full-time.  and this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>that's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
very attractive.  good idea.  now i <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
about jenny.  tell me about jenny.  about the <u>deal</u>.  whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
dr. kurtzweil, i'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. i don't believe in the elders of zion, the knights templar, the bilderburg group or in a oneworld jew run government --
they're in that fucking thing for forty hours, gordon.  four-oh.  he got julia at seven-thirty last night.  you know what time it is now...?!
they're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
no, you don't.... if you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. you know what tefillin is? tsitsis? shotness? you know the kaddish from the kiddush?  eichmann? he went to israel. he studied the torah, the talmud, the mishnah, the whole bit. he hated jews.
fuck you. i hate the jews at least as much as you do.
how come you don't know it?  how can you say you hate the jews when you don't know anything about --
danny, it's true. there were no six million. at most, two hundred thousand jews died in the camps. and the majority of them were from disease and --
maybe i am. maybe we're all jews now. what's the difference?
you're a jew. maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
come on, we can be like eichmann. he studied torah. he hated jews.
believe me, adolf hitler couldn't possibly have hated the jews as much as i do. not in a billion years. you know why?
is that why you became a nazi? so you could talk about jews incessantly?
the real nazis. hitler, goebbels, they talked about jews incessantly.... you ever read their diaries?...
it's all you talk about. jewish, jewish, jewish. nobody talks about it that much except the jews.
who gets contaminated, the jews or the gentiles?
see, the jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the sabbath from the week, the jew from the gentile.... as if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
that was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... anyway, the jews know where the sentences end. they know the whole thing by heart. every word. every letter.
yeah, i remember.... kill any jews yet?
yes, of course. but that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves nazis. if you want a modern fascism, you don't mention jews.
we want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>the bell curve</i>, <i>sociobiology</i>, anti-zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... we'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, jews. chomsky, cockburn, stanley crouch, shahack....
people hate jews. do you agree?
but if the jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
it's slander. it's reckless disregard. i'll sue you and your fucking jew paper.
differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. for the jew, his jewishness dominates everything. even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. they're still just jews.
are all jews the same?
of course they're jews.
those aren't jews.
deracinate... tear out the roots. a people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. this is how they know themselves. but the jew doesn't have soil.
the jews clearly control the media and the banks. investment banks, not the commercial ones. but the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. they undermine traditional life they deracinate society.
so, fine, it's not that the jew, the jews own the media and the banks. it's that they're sexually corrupt.
does that mean the jew is the better lover?
real men -- white, christian men -- we fuck a woman. we make her come with our cocks. but the jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  after a woman has been with a jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. a normal man.
because the jew is essentially female.
yes. it's very pleasurable. but the jews are obsessed with it. you know why?
the jews are different.... blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. the jews are...a poison in the human well....
danny, what about the jews?
so are you... but they'll believe you....  lina moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. that you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  ah, jesus, danny... what were you thinking? are you glad manzetti's dead? do you really want to kill jews? you want to kill me?
you know the joke: a jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. when they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. they say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? he says, vun to pray in, and vun i'd never set foot in so long as i live, so help me god.  you pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
so what jew would you kill first?
i've gotta kill some jews, kyle. i'm serious. i'm always talking about it. this time it's gotta happen.
shoot him in the head. always shoot a jew in the head.
i was a jew in a previous life.
how did you know they were jews?
you want to kill a jew. i already did.
danny, please. just give your speech.... and nothing about jews, okay?
look, if you want to kill jews on your free time, fine. we need you to raise money. will you do that for us?
yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the final solution. really, who but a jew would want to kill ilio manzetti simply because he was jewish? who thinks about such things?
you shot the leopard. we know that. you killed consuelo. you killed clo clo. then tonight --
the ladys not a friend. shes a whore.  someone at a special screening i attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an austrian here in london. and not just movies.
theyre german jews. came here before the war. they both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon. its not guilt, more of a curse...  and then theres something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters... but i think thats just one of leons dark delusions...
fucked-up fucking weird.
thats the beauty. an anonymous call. makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, french-fuck?
no, you must come, jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... i have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and la hire hardly swears at all anymore...  you can't stay -- they'll burn you!
if you kill him, you kill me!
don't forget, mr. wladek, they hang them for helping jews.
american jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? what do they think they're doing? people here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. the jewish bankers over there should be persuading america to declare war on germany!
oh? more jewish police? you mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up jews with my truncheon and catch the gestapo spirit. i see!
don't be clever with me, henryk. i've come here as a friend. they're bringing jews in from all over the country. soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. we need more jewish police...
they're in shock. they didn't expect it. nobody expected it. jews fighting back? who'd have thought?
jesus! i'll kill him! i'll kill him. what did she tell him?
we got word from chicago.  they got one of the grifters last night. the nigger.
it's foolproof.  we got a partner downtown runs the central office of the western union.  race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  all he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  it can't miss, unless the western union dicks get onto it.
cause i'm tired of bein' his nigger.  i want you to help me break him.
i'll get some towels.
i don't want to see people killed any more than you.  but we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
i don't know.  he didn't have a uniform on.  he...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed wes.
even if they are iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  they don't want any trouble.
what we're doing is kicking ass.  for god's sake they got iraqis surrendering to news crews.  the war is over.  we've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
you know what?  i think you got schwarzkopf.  you did!  you got the general right in the ass.  now that's good shooting.
we just about got killed.  you know what happened?  we just about got killed, and you want to go on?
birth born....ummm...sexact.
<u>grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>this</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
i'd rather be his whore than your wife.
where are you going? to him? is that it? to be a whore to that gutter rat?
what made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! look at me, you filth! what did you think you were doing?!
you whore!  you filthy whore!
you know, frederic-fucking-chopin.
you know nothing.  what you don't know would fill a book.  jesus, i feel like it's when you're around i need it most.  you're never yourself, you never relax.  never. everything's so stiff and dead. you always have to keep a rein on everything, ever yourself.  oh, you smile sometimes, i've even seen you laugh.  but there's no light in your smile for me, wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. and i get cold, wyatt.  i get so cold.  what's between you and that jew woman?
chick was outright killed by a mob. he killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
if you start in on the war metaphors i'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
fuck you.  i wasn't doing anything. you're like the gestapo.
he's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
ach, that's what i'm talking about. sarcasm.  always fucking sarcasm. you're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
this is fucking crazy.  instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  do you know who frankie flowers is?  he's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  a faggot.  he's killed fucking who knows how many people. you'd need half the force to get close to him.  and you can't get their help because he lives in fucking san diego.
i've read official estimates but i wouldn't bet my house on them.  i've heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor-trailers.  at least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
hey man, back the fuck up.  to this place.  what's that shit?  right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, you got any drugs?  you know where i can get drugs?  what kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities?  if you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, indian hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. it's market forces, man.  the product's marked up three hundred percent.  you can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.  you think white people would still be going to law school?
mapping the fucking pig genome. we'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
what do we do?  okay.  fucked-up bowman's turning blue.  doctor.  we need a doctor.
i'd fucking kill you.
four kilos. that's what -- ten years' worth? russian sailors? mikey forrester? what the fuck are you on these days? you've been to jail, spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
i'm a fugitive from the law. i can't be seen on the fucking streets. now watch my lips. kempton park. two-thirty. five pounds to win. bad boy.
i've no fucking cigarettes.
and that's what's illegal. do you know what they do to people like me inside? they'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
people think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. otherwise we wouldn't do it. after all, we're not fucking stupid. at least, we're not that fucking stupid. take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. when you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. when you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. got no money: can't get pished. got money: drinking too much. can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. got a bird: too much hassle. you have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
and see when i get out of here. i've got plans. going to get myself straightened out and head off to thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. see, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. no fucking problem.
no, not homeless people. beggars, francis begbie -- one of my mates. i wouldn't say my best mate, i mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  your phones are almost certainly tapped.  and you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this renquist, who may be a--
but knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. i love airports now. me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
you're a whore?
the oriental in black. he's an assasin. now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. so he got himself arrested. they take him into the police station. and he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. does a number on him. kicks the cops' asses some more. kicks the bars out of the window. and jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. now what would you do.
nigger, get real. you touch jayne kennedy she'll have you ass in wayne county so fast -
killin' 'em's the hard part. gettin' away with it's the easy part. whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? they couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. if you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
wannabee nigger...
what's so fuckin' good about it? actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. it's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their sag card. oh, guess what? i had a really good reading for "t.j. hooker" the other day.
i don't blame you.  so we'd both fuck elvis. it's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
he says wednesday at three o'clock at the beverly wilshire. he wants everybody there.  he'll talk to you. if after talkin' to you he's convinced you're ok, he'll do business. if not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. he also wants a sample bag.
like, look at her. she looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. elvis wouldn't fuck her with pat boone's dick.
you're always making jokes. that's what you do, isn't it? make jokes. making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? but if you make a joke about this -  - i'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! i can't believe how much like your mother you are. you're your fuckin' mother through and through. i haven't heard from ya in three years. then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. you walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, i'm happy to see you... just slow it down. now, when did you get married?
it's a fact. sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. if you don't believe me, look it up. you see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the moors conquered sicily. and moors are niggers. way back then, sicilians were like the wops in northern italy. blond hair, blue eyes. but, once the moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. they did so much fuckin' with the sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. i find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, sicilians still carry that nigger gene. i'm just quotin' history. it's a fact. it's written. your ancestors were niggers. your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. that is a fact. now tell me, am i lyin'?
you know i read a lot. especially things that have to do with history. i find that shit fascinating. in fact, i don't know if you know this or not, sicilians were spawned by niggers.
i'm talkin' about a massacre. they snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. a whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
now i can't be sure of how much of what he told you. so in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. that whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and i don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
shit, are you behind. me and robin got a divorce six months ago. got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. guy'd have to look as ugly as king kong not to get laid in this place. i'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
but there is a bright side though. if you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
you're a fuckin' star! and you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
shit, man, you done fucked up again. next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.
you see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? you're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! gonna come in here and tell me! talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. shit! your ass must be crazy.  i don't think that white boy's got good sense. hey, marty.  he must of thought it was white boy day. it ain't white boy day, is it?
you ok? that stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
rock whores.
nigger, you lie like a big dog.
nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
what was the jew-boy's name?
listen, you dumb fuck!  the thing mutates we live underground!  the world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  we're like moles or worms.  all we want to do is study the original...
bulishit!  you're fucking with my head!
me?  are you kiddin?  you're the one! you were a hero, man.  they gave you a pardon!  and whadda you do?  you come back and fuck with your teeth!  wow!
this is a fucking experiment!  you're our helpless little test animal, daddy. got that?  now -- what fucking virus have you come up with, you demented fucking maniac?
listen you stupid fuck, i want my car.
<u>we</u> killed jake.  and it's a big difference.  you kill an old man, that's one thing.  nobody cares about an old man.  you kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. never.
there isn't!  there's nothing under here but more floor.  jesus fucking christ!  we killed a man for nothing but floor.
oh, that's great.  we killed jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. that's fucking brilliant!
you know what kind of woman grace is.  you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of sierra.  what makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  what's she to you, jake a woman who would have you dead?  let me kill her.  all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
i hate loving her.  i hate the kind of her person she is.  i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  i hate letting her use me. but i love her too much to do otherwise.  and i certainly love her too much to kill her.  i couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  but you?  you got the killing in you, boy.
i know all right.  i know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  you've probably bagged a few at that. you'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  from that you'd just turn and walk away.  but to kill to get that blood on your hands.  you can't wash that off. you'd be a marked man for life. just like cain.  and you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. ain't that right, boy?
how the hell should i know?  i've never had a wife killed before.  i guess i should have hired a professional.
if you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
is this what it's all about?  you sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  forget it.  you want to take my head off, mister, i won't even try to stop you.  i deserve it for being an idiot.  but if you're not, i think i'll be on my way.
you're fucked.
fucking kid.  and look at you breaking fucking pencils.  you're a neanderthal.
things ain't always the way they seem. you got to ask yourself: is it worth it? day comes earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
you know what kind of woman grace is, jake. you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of superior.  what's she to you, jake a woman who wants you dead?  let me kill her.  all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
how the hell should i know?  i've never had a wife killed before. jesus christ! <u>you</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? i guess i should have hired a professional.
if you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? the thing is it's got to look like an accident that's the thing. if it doesn't, then it's no good.  i won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
listen you stupid fuck, i want my car.
...but i bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. how old crazy jake <u>was really her papa</u>. and she <u>liked</u> fucking papa! and now she's killed the sonufabitch! just like she's gonna kill you!
i don't want the fuckin' money! i'm not gonna give up everything i got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. it's <u>you</u>. you <u>grace</u> or nothing. the whole thing... i want you to be my wife.... what do you way grace?
get out of the car, spread them. you can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! you commie motherfucker. either way you're goin' to the can.
like whores?
what you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  fuck 'em? fuck 'em a thousand times?  the kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. they won't just cut your face up a little.  stupid cunts!
i could run off them whores.
they really got all that money, them whores?
...they been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up delilah.
them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
i have done that... killed women and children... i have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now i have come to kill you, little bill, for what you done to ned.  now step aside. boys.
nobody didn't kill ned, he went south yesterday. he didn't even kill nobody. why would anybody kill ned?
bet your ass i kin see fifty yards an' i kin shoot this sonofabitch...
we got to kill this other one first.  shit, ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
five. i killed five of 'em.  that counts a mexican i killed.  he come at me with a knife.
they fucking know everything.
i know you. you don't think i know you're on the take. this whole fucking precinct is dirty. you don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
you know. you've known this whole fucking time. give it to me.
gee, thanks, dave. bang-up job so far. extortion, coercion. you'll pardon me if i ask you to kiss my pucker. the same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me they'll bail me out? fuck you. you think you can catch keyser soze? you think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? if he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  after that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
i don't think you do. but you say you saw keaton die. i think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. i think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. my bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. you tell me he's dead, so be it. i want to make sure he's dead before i go back to new york.
well, maybe you better do that, then.   you know you guys are all the same. you don't care who gets hurt. you're a bunch of whores.  you'd do anything for a dollar.  you got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
`you guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
that's the point, you stupid fuck. let them buy it.  we let them buy the case.  that's what i took it for.  you let this drop -- we'll go up to new hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
... i get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --i get this expert doctor to talk to you.  i'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  you're 'sposed to be in court.  i bet you haven't even seen the file.
a huge law firm.  okay?  they put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'you must drop by with pat and me...'  okay...?
where were you born?
that's a horrible ugly comment. "dead whore?" she's a person!
i'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
don't you fucking threaten me - i'll fucking kill you.
fucking boyd. that fucking idiot. they're on to us.
franco mother-fucking harris!
she's asian. they don't have jews in asia.
someone goes to walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, spic and span, the works.
they're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. go get some fucking starbursts.
that's what i'm saying. let the israelis straighten it up. they got plenty of room down there, number one. plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the jews and the mexicans. so i think on a whole your average joe mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. am i right?
lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. the whole country picks up and takes mexico.
now if i'm the king of israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? am i right?
i say to myself, look at the map. look what's all around you. people who wish bad bad things for you and your people. for thousands of years the jews are fighting everybody. it used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. then the gunpowder revolution. now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.

sir larry wildman. like all brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole rdl pharmaceuticals right out from under me. wildman the white knight.
don't i, norman?  you kept the fucking necklace.  of a woman you killed!
i may have seen her on campus.
you kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
nope-  my father died before i was born. my mother died in childbirth.   el1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after i was born.
it was wrong - all my life i have been cheated - cheated of anything good - i shouldn't have been born - i was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
ok, the press call you the white angle because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
wasn't enough van ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  he got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  one trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  that came with her.
hunter's making it our job because sandra van ryan's got a bug up his ass. you know that as well as i do.  we're gonna trash this guy's life and i keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
good.  so what we're going to do is march right to hunter's doorstep.  we're going to insist they take a statement. we're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  they're walking a fine line here. defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  you weren't supposed to kill her for christ's sake.
good.  just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
exactly.  any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  and what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
a whore fucking.
fine, but the civil terrorism unit?  it's a fucking gestapo!  dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
oh, i am, honey.  you see, russian tanks are crossing the afghan border this very minute.  and we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
silent night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. the black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. when it settles down to earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
you're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. they'll believe me.  i've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
