bogey lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that.
are you kidding?  he'll piss himself with joy.  he's the ultimate kiss ass.
joey dorsey?  perma-shit-grin.  i wish i could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  and a model.  mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
he always have that shit-eating grin?
enough with the barbie n' ken shit. i know.
watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
you better not fuck this up.  i'm heavily invested.
yeah, but then i fucked up. i fell for her.
so what ' s up with your dad?  he a pain in the ass?
come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
no ... i believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
man -- don't say shit like that to  me. people can hear you.
can't be that far, i say.  also, i don't like the smell of the sea around here.  smells like a cunt. bad sign...
what are you listening to, chicken ass?
yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
no, he is here.  shit...
oh no!  no!  shit!
oh really.  that's nice.  you took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  are you out of your fucking mind??  are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
yeah, just her in the shower.  nothing happened.  look, i'm sure you probably think i'm a fool and i fucked up, but...
she's fucked.  even if that story is true.
you were merciless.  you didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
look, man, i don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
oh, shit.  i hate looking at that!
whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
turn that fucking thing off!
don't give me that fucking shit.
alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
there was a woman - i think she wanted to talk to us.  she looked scared.  oh shit!  oh no!
i don't give a shit who you ask.
fuck off.  i don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
don't give me that police shit. you drop it.
you lying son of a bitch...
i'll be there in a minute. you don't move your ass, right?
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
i let women get to me.  the quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... i got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  they got nothing to do with helping you make it.
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass, i'd  just leave town.
i had no choice. some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac.
jesus christ.  that's a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
shit.
i wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw luther. you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, jack.
you son of a bitch. you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
they saved your ass, convict.
luther knew more than he told me and so do you...now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  i gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
you?  don't make me laugh.  you can't take care of shit.  you've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  all you're good for is games... so far, what i got outta you is nothin'...
if they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
she's got the same complaint as half the goddamn population.  she can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... anyway, what the fuck do you care?
bullshit ... i ain't moving  till i get something to eat. you've been treating me like shit ever since i came out here.  if you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  and i want some food some place nice.. some good people, nice music...
yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. and i didn't get you out so you could go on a goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
do you know how close i was to getting some trim.  and you fucked' it up.
shit.  i'm already sorry.
you just don't get it, do your reggie?  there isn't any deal. i own your ass.
you got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... how you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
too bad, it would've covered your ass.  now you're in the shit and so's the department. in case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... i told you everyone was watchin' on this one. maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
right.  i screwed up.  i fucked up. i messed up.  anybody could have done better, especially you. i bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
try not to get your ass shot to pieces. we got enough dead cops on this one.
hey ... dick tracy.
shit.
who gives a fuck what you think?
yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
i can see that.  pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  what happened?
fuck you.
i didn't get burned, two cops did. listen, i'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  i like to get the job done right.  and if i don't get my job done right... i'm for shit.
then i sit back and i think, i mean, who's to say i'm not a dumb bitch.  i work in a bar, right? i can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... you are what you do...
a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
fuck you.  you got no right for this kind of play.
this is clean shit.  no serial numbers and never been used...
i'm sure.  everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
i'm fucked!
trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
like shit.
you still pining for that two timing bitch. forget her. there are a million women out there.
fuck it! hold tight!
...shit!
good philosophy..see good in bad.. i like..i prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
don't fuck with me man or i'll blow you into tomorrow!
who gives a shit! i didn't come here to listen to music! listen up instead of running off at the mouth! the batteries on my phone are almost gone.
look where we are.  look at yourself.  you son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
there ain't no such thing as snuff. why don't you fuck off?
mixed hard bondage.  rape films. sick shit.  buy five, get one free.
what the fuck... !
there's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  think about it.  there's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  i want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again i'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  why are you bothering me with this... ?
the loop!  the girl we did, what the fuck do you think i'm talking about?!  this guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
shut up, cunt!  do exactly as i say, or i'll put this arrow through your throat.
fuck off.
i fucking don't know.  what do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  we didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  we dug a hole and we put her in it. your guess is as good as mine.
there wasn't nobody around.  this place was a shit-hole.  i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and machine went to work.
fuck you then, you want to know?  i talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  i told her i was gonna get her a screen test, and while i'm doing that, i got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  when it was dark enough, i rang dino and told him it was go time, i put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  that's what happened.  she's dead.  she's been dead a long fucking time.  nobody fucking cares!
what the fuck do you want from me?
it was a lot of fucking money.
thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
yeah, the fucking lawyer.
fuck you!
you killed that girl and you put it on film.  you and your pals, you're fucked.  you fucked up real good.
what the fuck are you.. ?
fuck you!
get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  till then, fuck you.
fuck you.
just tell me.  tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared. what kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  what the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
yeah, i'm a real genius.  what choices have i got?  fuck, just because i know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean i deal it.  i work a job.  it beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
cut that shit out.  maybe before, but not now. i want to help you. i'm on your side.
sorry!! sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. in case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and i'm the last course!!
no shit.
maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that polly perfect shit.
i'm very fucking sorry, but greta is dead today.  could we interest you in someone else?
look.  dan's parents were pushing him. pushing him hard.  he was bitching about it at the party last night.  he was under pressure.  we all are.
same old shit.
shit! what are we gonna do?
might as well take the rest of the day off. you look sort of fucked up. you've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
nope. heard it. we wasn't far apart. i spotted this buck, then i heard the gun go off and twombley was gone. i looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. called it right in.
fresh tracks.  deer shit. big one. here's your buck, mr. twombley. i'll circle around.
ruined my arm. brought me along too fast. why'd it have to be my fucking arm, i used to think. then i realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
the only difference between me and that clemens on tv is luck, shit luck.
i'm fucking out of here.
let's get the fuck outta here. you're not making any sense, man.
what the fuck you telling me, wade? i never seen the guy get shot, i told you that.
who the fuck knows? musta slipped or something. i just heard the gun go off.

shit.
you gotta be more careful about that shit. gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. and i'll be outta a job.
lariviere's having a hell of a time in there. master of fucking ceremonies.
come and get you! shit! it's a damn half hour drive each way. why didn't you talk to me about it first?
what the fuck. my day's already ruined.  give me the keys. you can go back with jack. you still got a shitload of plowing to do.
let's get to the top and talk to jack first. he'll know what happened. he fucking better. if this coulda been avoided, i'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
you ain't the hunter jack is. and he can't drive the grader worth shit.
i wish you had. i'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
yes, wade, i mean twombley. put out that cigarette. fuck. fuck. fuck.
fuck. you don't know how bad or anything?
fuck. turn it off.  all you heard was there was some kinda accident?
fuck you.
at the school crossing. in his bmw. coulda hurt some kids. i'm gonna bust his ass.
oh, jesus, lay off, will you? it looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for christ's sake.
look, that's temporary, believe me. there's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by lariviere and merritt won't matter a bit.
it's my tooth! my fucking tooth! i can't even think anymore because of it.
no. not for money. but, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- i was pretty fucked up, you know.
i'm going to start one of those custody suits. i don't give a fucking shit. you know?
fuck. wade whitehouse. it's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
nothing in the fucking house to drink. not a fucking thing. my house, my money, my truck -- stolen!

shit.
cut the doubting thomas shit, elaine.  i know where i'm coming from on this.
oil pressure. i forgot to check the oil pressure. when kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
it's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
it's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much i hate his guts.
i may be an asshole, but at least i'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
shit!
fuck procedure.
george, c'mon -- lighten up.  it's a beauty of a case.  don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. he ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
what's this nothing shit?  it wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  don't lie to me, george, you're bad at it.
... and porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  so what the hell's the connection?
no shit, holmes.  you're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
sticking out of his ass... yeah! see, that's what makes it a joke. there's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  nada, huh?
through his ass.  next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
we were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
i don't think i could ever learn to read that shit.  how long did it take you to learn english?
rudyard kipling?  no shit?  listen, we just need a minute of your time...
the guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but i don't think that's what they were there for.  i think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, george...

i want to get high off this bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking all-bran.
it's a fucking milligram of sweet'n low!
is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  oh my god...
there's this theory out now that if you can catch the aids virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
stop sounding so fucking sad! jesus!
oh god, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
yeah. no finlandia, as usual. fucking dump.
come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  i've got a preview of the barneys catalogue and a bottle of absolut waiting for us.
evelyn. great ass. goes out with that loser patrick bateman. what a dork.
i just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. how can you be so fucking, i don't know, cool about it?
what shit? now where do we have reservations at? i mean i'm not really hungry, but i would like to have reservations somewhere.
how can he lie like that? how can he pull that shit?
now what are we doing? i don't get any of this shit!
not yet. 'love to bust my ass cause i'm not in frigging mensa.  i swear to god, it's that kid milo, i told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  let's run a printout on card entries.
yes, well...agent kensington will get you set up. she's very dedicated. perhaps, a little too dedicated.  she's got a bit of a bug up her ass. good luck, austin, the world's depending on you.
i'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
i never forget a pussy... cat.
but my design was perfect!  your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
i had the group liquidated, you little shit. they were insolent.
shit!
shit, shit, shit, shit. my car's gone!
i hate her. i hate her guts, the bitch.
my marriage is the worst. all crap. a big pile of shit.

that was an accident! jesus christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? why didn't you listen to me!
you crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
they were for the fucking boat, brian.
maybe i do.  ...what a fuckin' mess, huh?  people can change brian.
-- okay, so you don't like me. you don't like everything i've done. what, because i wasn't such a genius the way i raised you? jesus christ, dad was gone, what was i supposed to do? you tell me, what the fuck was i supposed to do?!
fuck you.
he didn't listen? he was a fucking candidate! he was your responsibility. he shouldn't have been there in the first place, stephen.  you burned him.
dad's way? where did he tell you that? in a fucking seance?
i waited... i would have fucking waited...
-- i was doin' it! i was up there fucking doin' it. you don't know, man, you don't know what i did!
so that's it? big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till i cough blood?
-- you could have scared the son of a bitch off. we may never bust him now. all for a couple's political points.
you told swayzak about our arson lead. it's all over the fucking news.
jesus, give him a break. there isn't enough proof yet to go public. sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. not 'till it's locked.
who the fuck is doing this?
who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
son of a bitch. they knew each other.
that's it! oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! you see what this tells us, huh? our killer doesn't love fire!
son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
y'know what stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "you never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
you crooked son of a bitch. why 115?
fireman shit?
you treated me like shit.
just catch the son of a bitch.
how come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the church haven't come up with shit? you got some kinda inside track?
those fucking mob assholes.
christ! shit! i could kill them all with my bare hands.
i'm not talking about the fucking church. fuck the church. but tell me. do you believe in god?
she's fucking nine years old! jesus christ.
they're alive, aren't they? come on, man! everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 g for the guys who dared to rape her. do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? of course not. or even for your little sister? the virgin? like shit they would.
i'm gonna need some bread, man. this ain't fair. i'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. my landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! you're two months behind on the rent, lieutenant!
fuck you.  just give me back a little something for the road.
the rich kind.  jeez, man. the way you smoke that shit is suicide.
what the fuck are you? a drug counselor or a drug dealer? and you don't even do your own product! what kind of businessman are you?
you can't forgive me. after what i've done.  i've fucked up bigtime. i've been bad. real bad.
yeah, really. i'm no fucking asshole, man. i'm a fucking cop!
fuck yesterday's game. the world series is seven games not six. put in my bet.
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  never any other way. so you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. the big one. come on! are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
the fucking rapists, man. the punks who raped that nun. the $50,000 reward from the church! remember?
oooo... big fucking scary guy. just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
fuck strawberry. you're gonna end up owing 60 g to a homicidal maniac!
double or nothing? are you fucking out of your mind?
hey, man. don't give me that bullshit. don't pussy-out on me. the mets are a fucking lock. i wanna make some money.
so now i see where you're coming from.  just because we ain't rapping about gucci, timberland, rolex, benz, cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
i don't give a good goddamn about finland, norway, sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
besides, what does he know about negroes?
i understand black culture.  i grew up around black people all my life. if the truth be told i probably know "niggers" better than you, monsieur delacroix.  please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote n word.  i got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so i feel i have a right to use that word.  i don't give a damn what spike says, tarantino is right.  nigger is just a word.  if dirty ole bastard can use it every other word so can i.
dela, kiss my big black ass.
like i said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  dunwitty, he just tolerates your negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
i wouldn't bet against it.  my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
fuck da money.  why do through all this effort?  why?  are you looking for love from dunwitty?  for respect?  dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  so now what are you gonna do?
why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
and now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
yo, dela, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
did you just ask me what's a negro? i'm a negro!!!
what's a negro.
yes, i know.  jukka, have you ever seen a negro person before?  even had a real conversation with a real negro before?
so you say.  sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used dela? work it to the top.  i never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "ihop."  i'm damn happy dela fired ya ass.
worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
it was the grenade you fucking idiot. look at him!
fuck, what the fuck is going on --
just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? i'll take care of this.
a target, kendall, cap a fucking target. what's wrong with you?
hey, i --  holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
fuck "you're serious", raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
that son of a bitch.
what the fuck is going on?
roberto, what the fuck?
i think you just blew "don't ask, don't tell" out of the fucking water.
i'm talking about west! we had him, bill, we were there. you're the fucking base commander, you knew what he did to cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
you want a confession? why don't you confess, bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
no, i didn't. i wanted to humiliate him. for what he did to dunbar. for fucking over the little guy.
we're fucked, i know --
oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! this isn't my "great second chance", osborne. everyone thinks i'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. nobody will ever know what happens here --
you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? he deserved it. there's your confession.
why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
you guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
the thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. you turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
poor fucker my ass...
oh, yeah, "excuse me, sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." he'll kick our asses from here to cleveland.
the fuck are you talking about --
shut the fuck up.  he was gonna cut him loose.
what the fuck are you doing?
what the fuck happened to you --
sure i do. you were hot shit back in hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. you don't have a plan. you don't have a job. you don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
i'll fuckin' give it to him! we'll go down there.
put the fucking kettle down. tell, yuri, tell him put it down or i'm going to make him.

look. i'm ready to get the fuck out of here. it's real torture for me to be here. getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans.
i don't really feel like talking about it. the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
that coward. son of a bitch.
what the fuck is going on here?
right. get back to me on that one. once your plan is worth a shit.
oh, shit. that was scary. in the middle of the robbery. the manager looks at me. right in the eye. and goes, i'm going to remember you.
holy shit.
anthony, give me the fucking gun!
holy shit. what'd i tell you?
yeah, but i can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. there's just not time for it.
you know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
i don't know. i personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
what the fuck is dignan doing with that cop? he loves them.
i don't know why the fuck we're having a party. the damn job's not over yet.
why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? it doesn't make any goddamn sense.
there's a lot of valuable shit in there, applejack. the silver and the china. the crystal. and the grandfather clock. goddammit, i bet that clock's worth ten grand.
that's just what the da asked. crs is a disease where you can't remember shit.

what's your fucking problem? you're a shithead!
i know that now. he's a fucking psycho.
the guy is fucking insane.
fuck you. you a hoto.
my ass he does. you're playing with fire, pamela. marshall said nail him to the wall. i don't know how you interpreted that, but i don't think he meant repatriate him.
i've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. i've shoveled shit on four continents. i'm due to retire next year and believe me, i need my pension, but if you think i'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. marshall too.  it had to be done.
oh, shit...
i just need the entry about the blockbuster. wait, shit, no arms. i never even got the chance to write it.
shit. i knew you were crazy.
best not bitch up. wind up someone's luggage that way.
fuck off, frat boy.
what the fuck are you doing?
he saved mrs. halpern? please, the twisted fuck.
i'm over it. whenever i try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
there is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that i was in some fuckin' sorority.
shit. i dunno. how would i know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
i couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly i'm too tired to prove it to you.
on the bridge. how did you know that tommy had your dog? that was no fucking hunch.
i've seen some sickening shit. i don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
he's a fucking maniac!
don't give me this oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
who are you trying to convince, evan?! you come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? you want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? well fuck you, evan! nothing's gonna be all better! okay?! nothing ever gets better!
what are you talking about? what you deserve is a better brother and father. all they do is make you feel like shit.
shit, lenny. what's happened to you! we've gotta get help!
and i'll tell the child protective services about your kiddie porn endeavors. one step closer and i'll shove this up your ass!
quit acting like some retard or i'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
typical psych major. a complete wise ass. and how's your project coming? still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
freeze! no "worm-boy". no "mr. worm," and no "worm-master-general!" once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. and i don't want everyone thinking i've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
right, evan. i believe you just said "sick fuck."
no one thinks you're a piece of shit, tommy.
it wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think i was a piece of shit.
get this "us" shit. as if i was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. you've done nicely for yourself, evan. nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. not a bad piece of ass if i say so myself.
wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. you see the way evan's mom was looking at you?
what did i say about mentioning that bitch?
you're such a retard!
then we've just got shit.
it's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
thank you for fucking up my life.
shit!  shit!  shit!
why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch i was.
what do you want me to say?  that i thought i'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did?
to life.  fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
when i first showed up, i thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
you beat 'em to shit, pal!  jesus!
you're fucking dead!
god damn!  god damn!  chuck, it's you!
you fucked us over.
shit. we don't know what he is.
alright... turn around. she doesn't get shit, unless i get that money. where is it?
my father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. the same numbers everyday for sixteen years. one day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. they hit the lucky seven for one point two million.
cue the fucking violins. come on... it's getting cold.
this might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea i've ever heard.
alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. is this the best thing to do?
fuck that. we're going too.
independent. same shit, just independent. they call him the king pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... big. fat. bald.
currently, the king pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
moonan. here. shit...
what do i always tell you guys? don't spend it all. sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. save some. put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. that's it. the gig's up.
so then miles walks straight into the creative director's office and says "the code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
well, this is just fucking great...
shit.
i said take off your fucking shirt.
that's more than you already owe me. what happens if you fuck this up?
fucking grifters! i love it! you got balls, i'll give you that much.
well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. what are we going to do about this jake? we can't afford to have a fed onto us.
was that a threat? did i hear a threat? last i remember, we were talking economics, then this...? what happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? well, shit... then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
all the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? you guys got sack.
listen to me! it went to shit. it happens sometimes.
y-y-you fucking shot him! that's what happened!
you sold me out. you should have trusted me like i trusted you. you fucked up. you fucked up huge.
so there it is. you got that big itch you need to scratch. it's all about the fucking money. what do you want, an apology?
hey, we fucked once, honey. that hardly makes you a good judge of character. and don't think i didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
you are such a raving pussy sometimes.
i don't know. i packed up my shit and ran away. to this... so unlike you, i guess i do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
shit, what was that guy's name? i really liked him.
then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  he said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
he wasn't my boyfriend. i had a boyfriend at the time... what was his name? anyway, glenn was like thirty. i was only fifteen. but he was a nice guy. real sweet. liked to talk. we used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
so that was my part? smile and shake my ass?
sorry about your wallet, but if you think i'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out visa and a bad fake i.d., you're fucking crazy.  jake.
there is no scam! i've got a fucking sign on my back! i can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. you get it? it's over. we walk.
i'm getting clear of this. if you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. gordo?
yeah, or d, it's a dumb fucking idea...
it never worked before because a, they didn't flush the bank enough b, their corporate papers were for shit c, they didn't have someone on the inside with customs.
just an idea, but let's just fucking split. we'll meet up anywhere. akron or austin or atlanta. anywhere...
he got caught! your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
you really like that bitch don't you? i gotta tell you, i was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. you know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. but, if you're into her... that's cool.
that was fucking deep.
maybe he's got it right. maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
my fucking heart bleeds.
exactly. 'cept this gillette guy. he gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. meanwhile, the king sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or harlin watching the door.
i want to get out from under all this for good. and i want to fuck them all doing it.
you guy's are not working with me here. i just got off the phone with my boss. after he got done ripping me a new lincoln tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little i'm welcome back if we come up short. and now here you guys are, wasting my fucking time!
whaddya mean? we got dick.
this guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
bullshit it's cosmetic! my fucking tooth was cracked in half. i made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. the department's dental is for shit.
hope so. those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. one fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. one fifty! it's not even covered.
you think this is a good idea? we never did this kinda shit before.
your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. what do you think of that? i can't get a job now.  you bastard. you're no different from matt. a pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
you fucking little shit! you shopped me.
now he's a real shit. don't get friendly with him. i'm sure he's got his hand in the till. you know what he said to me once? "i want to fuck the whole world over. that's my mission." the shit!
crap. it's not relative. it's unfair. like your casino. it's designed unfair. and your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
i don't give a fuck about the sex. most men'll fuck a lamppost. he's just a miserable zombie. is that the way you feel now? is that what's happened to you?
-- it's because of the sex, isn't it? you don't like the sex in it.
is that your idea of a winner? he doesn't give a shit about anyone. he uses people and --
this fucking job's getting to you. you haven't written a fucking word since you started.
take that back!  fucking take that back. i'm not a cop any more.
what? you know what happened to me, don't you? that bitch bella shopped me. i'd like to beat the shit out of her.
that bitch? no.
i don't get you. even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
what the fuck are you talking about?
it was you, you shit.
you don't recognise me? you had me barred. you fucking little worm.
i'm not sure. i think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
remember what we found? fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. remember?
fuck that shit.
ass like your, i can see why he's worried you'll punk.
not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  i decide when i'm done with your boyfriend.  not him, and certainly not you.  unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
you got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
hell yeah.  there's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  you are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  used a car jack to blow out my u lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  so now i gotta get my wheels fixed.
or, i dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
hot run to 842 beulah, corner of haight... and you can tell your pal theo he just got his worthless ass fired. not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. the man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... the man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. the man for whom faking it was invented. christ, if i hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, i would have never known i even had sex with the prick.
well, amanda, this has been quite a night. so far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  what's next? projectile diarrhea?  man. what a stud, huh?
who's whiskey dick?
better ease up then, hawk. wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
waitaminit, dudes! i got it! we find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. what do you think?
so maybe we got enough for one ticket. fuck!
you call that john travolta/denny terio shit dancing? i wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
just for the record, i understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
...holy shit! i am in absolute trouble! i never should have let you drive, man! absolute fuckin' trouble!
what the fuck!
well, jam is in absolute trouble. he couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. you know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see peter criss's drum solo, never mind a whole kiss concert, check?
never mind with the too bad shit. i got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
shit, that dork is jam.
chief, here's a little secret. drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. now shit or get off the pot. do you wanna dance or do you wanna see kiss only on their album covers?
jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. we're totally committed. it's time to brainstorm.
christine stole it! asleep, my ass! the stella booted with your mom's wheels.
oh, i'm sorry, trip. what you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. no offense.
she was standing right over me when i was changing for fuck's sake.
the kiss tickets, you nimrod! they're just fuckin' gone! please tell me you have'm!
okay, i'm just a little mad now! jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
fuck you, lex! this whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. i just made an honest mistake.
man, that weed knocked christine on her ass. she's sleeping like a baby stella.
well, here we are back at fucking school again.
about fuckin' time if you ask me. i'm just going through the motions till i drop out anyway.
oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! you fuckin' jinxed us!
i knew it! i knew this was gonna happen! i had a bad feeling since last night. remember? we are so totally fucked!
that's some sick shit right there. did she comb your ass hair for you too?
you know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
yeah, right. she wishes. look at that big ass.
trip, you fuckin' asshole.
poor, jam, man. imagine having to stash your kiss records inside carly simon album covers. no question, mrs. bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
look, i want to live, but i don't know where the fuck i'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
please, sir, don't kick my ass! i'll do anything to get out of a beating!
yeeeehaaawww!! this is totally fuckin' curly, man! thank you god!
i didn't say shit.
i'm so scared... i just keep thinking that something awful has happened. it's my fucking stepdad. i know it.
fuck them.
i'm not. but you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
oh, please tell me, elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
you're such a fuck-ass.
oh, shit!
good lord.  so the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
yeah... you know...  fucking.
no, i don't think about fucking my family. that's sick!
i just turn the volume down and think about fucking alyssa milano.
i think about... fucking a lot during school.
it's not that. i mean mouthing off to your teachers. i'll admit... when dad told me what you said to ms. farmer, i laughed my ass off.
well, jim, i think you're full of shit!
so let me get this straight. no airline will claim ownership of the engine. so we have to wait for the faa to decide who fixes my roof.  fuck that. we're taking the money out of savings.
you're not a bitch.
our son just called me a bitch.
you can suck a fuck.
did you just call me a fuck-ass?
donnie? you're a dick.
what else? shit, principal cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
bullshit. smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. that's why papa smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
smurfette doesn't fuck.
no more fuckin' for her.
what is this shit?
fuck yeah there is! if the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
go back to china, bitch!
ruined a brand-new pair of lee press- ons.  well, i sat down for a beer and ka- blewey! next thing i know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. next thing i know, i'm ass up in loretta's flower bed.
oh shit!
bitch!
well, as my mother says at sunday dinner, "come and get it," bitch!
why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, loretta.
listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
the bitch.
that bitch from...
what a surprise. gladys leeman's finally gonna go to state. and she'll probably ride on becky's ass all the way to nationals, too.
...oh, yeah-right. i ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
hey! turn that float around. you think a swan's gonna swim ass first up main street?
this is the night you met clementine, joel. i remember watching you walk down the beach with her and i thought, oh shit.
shit. the last time i saw you.
yay! it'll be great! i'll get my shit.
but my sleeping is really fucked up.
joel, i'm not a concept. i want you to just keep that in your head. too many guys think i'm a concept or i complete them or i'm going to make them alive, but i'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. don't assign me yours.
this kid, joe early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
yes indeed.  fuck! they're erasing you, clem!
i'd make a fucking good mother! i love children! i'm creative and smart and i'd make a fucking good mother!
joel, we're fucking gonna talk about it!
oh shit. i remember this.  want to go?
i'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
yo ho ho!
god, that feels so fucking good. take yours off.
oh, geez, i'm full of shit. i already told you that.  anyway. see ya.
remember? "and you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/and i'm lost in the window/i hide on the stairway/i hang in the curtain/i sleep in your hat..."  oh, shit. i'm so stupid. sorry.
shit. shit. i know it's here. hold on.
yeah. although it hardly fits. i'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
joel, we've fucked. we've made love. like a million times. and we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. isn't that lovely?
oh, god. i miss her. i can't believe she's with that guy now! i'm never going to see her again. i love her so much. what a fucking monster she is!
gotta get home. how could she do this to me? how could she not care about what we meant to each other. what a fuck! what a fucking monster she is!
fuck you, clementine.
the thing is, joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be joel with the same fucking problems.
this guy's only half cooked. there's no time to fuck around, stan.
shit!
well, allow me to do the honors. it's fucking freezing and i need something.
yes, shit. oops, sorry!  sorry. it's just i told myself i wasn't going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it. like i psyched myself out.
neither do i... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
shit o dear, julian. do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
sissy. you're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
shit o goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
holy shit...
i'm in the second containment area. it's pitch black in here. there must have been a coolant leak. man, this shit is everywhere. i can't see a damn thing.
shit! do not do that! where the fuck are you?
shit, smith, you're going biblical on me.
i know what i saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
then who the fuck are you?
son of a bitch!
we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  fuck this ship.
that's bullshit and you know it! you built this fucking ship and all i've heard from you is bullshit!
smith? smith! fuck!
i didn't see anything and i don't have to see anything. this ship is fucked.
shit, doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
i can't believe this, i haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. why not mars, cap, mars has women...
brad, i really fuckin' hate mcdonald's, man. ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
apologize to that wimp? no way. fuck dennis taylor.
mister, if you don't shut up, i'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
don't give me that shit! i know you're still a virgin!
hey fuck you damone. there's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with stacy. what have you got to prove?
i can see it all now. this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer. you bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
you... are a wuss. part wimp. part pussy.
first he's gonna shit. and then he's gonna kill us.
make up your mind. is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
my brother is gonna shit.
they're fuckin' with us.
what the fuck is this guy doing?
you know, linda. i've finally figured it out. it's not sex i want. anyone can have sex.
no way! he just called him a dick.
yeah, but i fucked up. you can take it. really.
what?  what was that crazy bitch said to him?  there's a war on, man! people are being killed!
holy shit!
listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- i've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's my turn. "fuck you, officer, i'm in charge here, and i'm telling you we don't have room for you."
witchcraft? shit, you can't mean it!
fuck the car. they should make these things with a goddamn fm radio.
finish the fucking story! what happened?! what about the glands?
sure. that's a good idea. one whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
this is a fucking nightmare.
you filthy bastard. i should cave your fucking head in.
it's straight economics. this girl is a god-send. shit, she can make us a grand a day.
she's perfect for this gig. these cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. we can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... hell she's strong she'll hold her own.
well... it'll probably work out. we can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
shit. i met her on the plane and i had all that acid.  you know, those little blue barrels. i gave her a cap before i realized... she's a religious freak... jesus, she's never even had a drink.
fuck yes. i was beginning to think i was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
back the tape up. i need it again! let it roll! just as high as the fucker can go! and when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, i want you to throw that fucking radio into the tub with me!
i want that fucking radio!
of course, i'm your attorney, i'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
you're doomed. i'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. right there in that tub.
you evil son of a bitch. you better hope there's some thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
don't kid yourself. that portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. he's watching us like a hawk.
that depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
look over there. two women fucking a polar bear.
we wandered into a fucking time capsule!
jesus creeping shit!
holy shit! they almost had us there! that was quick thinking.
you bastard! they'll never let us back in that place. i leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! you scared the shit out of those people! they were ready to call the cops. hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
that's the press table. where you have to sign in for our credentials. shit, let's get it over with. you handle that, and i'll check on the room.
god didn't do that! you did it! you're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
what the fuck are we doing out here? somebody call the police! we need help!
yeah. i know. i'm guilty. i understand that. i knew it was a crime but i did it anyway. shit, why argue? i'm a fucking criminal.
what the fuck are you doing he's in there!
i figure it's karma. you wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
you can't keep me here. this is bullshit. fuckin' bullshit. this is fucking bullshit!
my god damn foot is gone! who fuckin' shot me? who fuckin' shot me!?
shit!
fuck you too.
fuck no.
look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. que sera-sera.
why do you take shit from him?
uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on daddy's face, i wanna do some appraising.
hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
you smell like ass!
f-f-fuck you.
move your ass!
shit.
shit!
no shit.
louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
so not only am i a troublesome bitch, but i'm fat too?
i don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but i don't think it was me.
you have no right! you have no fucking right, you bastards! get the hell out of here --
dick...
dick, i can't even breathe here...
dick, we need some time apart --
just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. come on, this is a joke! assault and battery? i barely touched that bitch!
i called your god-damned office! i want you to kill him, harry. you'll do that for me, won't you? i loved him, i loved him... that bastard.
yeah, if i don't make too big an ass of myself.
dick... and my mother! she acts like she's on mars or something --
shit. i meant the other way around.
shit!
'cause if it's long enough, which i doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
dr. symington, how big is your dick?
i'll be okay. holy shit...
holy shit...
did they look like psychos? they were fuckin' vampires. psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, i don't care how crazy they are.
why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
i'm running the show. i make the plays, and you back the plays i make. stop thinking with your fucking balls. kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to "go for it." i need your cover. cover my ass.
if trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, i can't do that. if you don't tell the cops, i will.
i don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. i just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as i can.
you bet your sweet ass you are, and i'm gonna help you do it. but we ain't got much time.
yeah, i know what's going on. we got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! that's it, plain and simple. and i don't wanna hear any bullshit about "i don't believe in vampires" because i don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. but i do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes i saw fuckin' vampires! now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
now, is your shit together?
are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
i'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. and that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
shit, i been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-h club.
look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. i don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. and i don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. you notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
jesus christ, pops, don't start with this shit.
i seem to have touched a nerve. don't be so sensitive, pops, let's keep this friendly. but you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  now, there's two ways we can play this hand. one way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. the other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, i'll win. but we go down the second, we'll both win. now, i don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. y'all can live forever or die this second and i don't care which. the only things i do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. and right now i need to get those three things into mexico. now, stop me if i'm wrong, but i take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. am i correct?
i've seen one of these before. a friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. away to fuck the irs. is that what you're doing, or are you the real mccoy?
that's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  go sit over there.
okay, jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. make a wrong move and i'll shoot you in the face.
i didn't say fuck him. i'm just not connected anymore.
richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
they'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. and if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. we'll get 'em all right. i gotta piss. i'm gonna use your commode.
what the hell would i do with that grease pit? besides, nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. then all this abilene shit happened. you heard about that bank robbery in abilene, didn't ya?
you could sue the shit out of her, ya know. that kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. you could own that fuckin' place.
isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
awww, it's just been a shitass day. every inch of it hot and miserable. first off, nadine at the blue chip got some sorta sick, so that mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. that fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from rice krispies. i ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! richie!
i want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "benny's world of blood."
well, then ask her, dumb ass.
well, it is. just because i'm happy doesn't mean i'm on vacation. you're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since i been happy. but my shit is forever together.
my shit is together.
no, you're not. you're sippin' margaritas in el ray. but we're not in el ray. we're here -- getting ready to go in there. you're so pleased with yourself about getting into mexico, you think the job's down. it ain't. get back on the clock. that's a fuck-with-you-bar. we hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. so get your shit together, brother.
what dya mean, don't worry about it. of course i'm gonna worry about it, i can't fuckin' see.
oh, fuck, seth, that's my only pair!
yeah, i guess. i'm just a little fucked up.
yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. it scared the shit outta me. sure you're okay?
oh, i know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and i broke it out? yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. not to mention stupid. but you know what? i can fix that right now.
yes, you did. you said as long as i don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that i've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
you just called me a fuckin' nut.
as long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
no.  that woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
what the fuck is she doin' there?!
what'd ya mean, what? the fuckin' woman, the hostage. where the fuck is she, richard!?
i heard it on the radio. we gotta get our asses into mexico tonight. carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then carlos and his boys will escort us to el ray and --
shit, i started to get worried. where the fuck ya been?
how ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
he didn't recognize shit.
what the fuck is wrong with you --
what the fuck was that about?
fuck me.
banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  shit, she was part of it!
shit.  think we're had.
jordan.  you watch your ass.
well, let me warm you:  i'm going though with this.  the more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  so don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
get your dick back here.  it has everything to do with you.
well, you're doin' shit-hot at intel.
so the shit you gotta go through? to get from here to there?  brother said it was worth it.  worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  but on every guard's chest,they left one marlboro cigarette.  just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  they found his tracks. well, shit.
right down to your worthless womb, and i'll tell you why.  this is my island.  my world.  and here i can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  if i can do that to a navy seal, what's gonna happen to you?  huh?
dick, jane, and spot.
well, who the shit you think you are?  comin' in here like that?
what's our go-to-shit plan, o'neil?
we are so fucked.
god, what an ass.
...damn you!  damn you!
hey, watch that "laredo" shit.
shit! i'm doing it! i'm repeating the damn computer!
shit! go!
you are so full of shit
hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
because, if the british got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  and the revolution would be finished.  tell king louis, it's that bad.
for god sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  you look like a damned slave!  it's damned humiliating.
the money. fuck. i gotta think...
shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
no shit? what're some of 'em?
look, there's no fuckin' way i'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. then we might have something to talk about. now step away from the car.
he's my sister's kid. no papa. not too bright. personally, i think he's a retard. i only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
how 'bout i give you to three, then i organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. one...
young? she's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as lovejoy's kid. bernie. one she calls bernard. have you read the script?
i put a gun right here...  ...and i tell him, 'sign the paper marty or your fuckin' dead.' like that.
no shit, come on. how you gonna do that?
i'm just explaining to you what i'm doing here. case you think i come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
i'm already in town, but it don't matter. we got dick in the bank. we dumped it all in harry's movie.
by friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
i can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
where's leo devoe? where's chili palmer? where's my fuckin' money?
or else use your fucking imagination.
maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' miami, dipshit. maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to l.a. and took a meeting with mr. zimm.
look, there's no reason you and i shouldn't get along. forget all the bullshit from before - i don't even remember how it started. you took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. you owe me some money, right? forget that too. but, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. it's strictly between you and me, right?
whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
tough shit, bro. this ain't miami. you want something, talk to me.
who the fuck are you?
who the fuck is momo? jesus, these fucking names...
harry, if i gave you leo's money you'd have ray bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
get the fuck outta my chair.
you tell me you want these guys off your back. next thing i know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of mr. lovejoy. i couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
i'm out here looking for leo. i just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, dick allen.
fuckin' basketball game.
dick allen's a very dear friend of mine. how far you want to go with this?
you know dick allen, mesa's casino?
exactly. you either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, i don't give a fuck. you don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, i go after him. the fuck you think i do?
you mean like we don't give a shit.
at eighteen percent, okay? and don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. i'm leaving.
i wouldn't let her if she tried. why i'm here, leo, basically, is to save your ass.
oh, shit... i'm sorry... i thought that was... i'm so sorry...
karen! what the fuck are you doing?!
guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for christ's sake.
i know i'm better than what i've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
i spent all day crawling out of a grave. the costumer kept bitching 'cause i was ripping my nylons -
hey, chil? i think you're fulla shit.
how you gonna do that? you don't know shit about making movies.
all i know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in vegas. i told him i don't know. i still don't.
you gonna start that again? you're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
no, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
don't say a fuckin' word.
what she did not say was, 'i just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' all she cared about was that look. all she remembered was that look. and why do we remember things in movies? because we can see them.
all these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
man's in town two days, thinks he's david o. fucking selznick.
'it' didn't slip away, martin, you did... when you went off to fuck nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? that's a damn big boat. it's either sunk or it ain't.
i didn't touch the fucking radio!  ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
i didn't touch the fucking radio.
what the fuck -- ?
yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
why not? why the fuck not?
looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
no cowboy shit. right.
no cowboy shit up there, understand?
ho-ly shit.
yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to sitka.
i can't believe this! i thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
i'll get a job tomorrow, i promise. if i don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
fuck you! have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
well, what am i supposed to say? "i can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
i think one of us should fuck josh...
i can't, it's seymour's birthday...  shit! what time is it?  i have to go to the store! i was going to make him a cake...
fuck it. everything must go!
i remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick daniel dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
i wonder if i hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. like i have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
you cunt!
give me all your money, bitch!
fuck you, bitch!
fuck you!
no, she was the second wife. the third one was the super-bitch - maxine.  there! look at her!
i can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
god, this paper is so boring. who reads all this shit?  here we go...  "windsurfing doctor, mensan iq, maverick sagittarius. let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
what?... oh suck my fucking dick!
god, what a bunch of retards...
i'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
if you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what i'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
god, fuck you!
i was just thinking out loud...  i mean, you've got this whole thing with dana -- i'm not going to let you fuck that up...
you know what we should do? let's go get in your car right now and just take off! we could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
oh yeah... and dana...  you were a lot more fun before you met dana. you've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, seymour, that's why i like you.
fuck dana. i'm sick of dana.
i dunno... okay, i guess...  i fucked that guy josh finally...
actually, i've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
what the fuck, seymour?! what is this?
mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
he has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
what the fuck is she doing?! she was supposed to be here three hours ago!
i have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
very moving, patterson i'm touched you confided in me.  but i don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. i've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
no, i guess i'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
forget it, venkman.  you had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  now it's my turn, smart-ass.
go ahead!  get a court order.  then i'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
oh, shit!
so far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto rican bellboy.
damn him!  i should have killed him on the front -- i let you talk me out of that.
i'll do it!  sure as there's shit in the tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
you'll never shit right again.
i got a lot of people work for me, lilly. i can't have shit like this.
i never fucked up before, bobo.
what the fuck are you doin with a son?
you're fuckin right you're not. how much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
did i buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
i'm wise to you, i should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. how is it, huh? how do you like --
mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. i've seen people like you before, baby. double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. but you don't make it work forever.
what the fuck are you talking about?
no shit.
no shit?!
shit, john!  what the hell were you doing out there?!
and i should have a son who calls me "mom".  looks like we're both shit out of luck.
shit happens.
shit, linda!
he gave me a fuckin' a?  wow.
fuckin' a.
you mean tommy.  yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  messed up his head.  he's harmless, though.  probably just lonely.
happy fuckin' halloween.
shit, beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? it's only halloween.
debra, you're fuckin' insane.
what the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
when i drive it, i feel like i'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  i don't hear anything, i don't feel anything.  i figure somebody else is driving.  it's a bitch.
thank god we found the fucking diamonds!
how everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  i used to be scared shitless i'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
oh, shit.
a bitch.
it's a bitch.
to make an ass of yourself.
pass the fucking catsup.
what you say is, "pass the fucking catsup."
beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
ram it up your ass!
you and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  you know who filled that bag for you?  not alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  men with guts filled it, by god--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
when i'm dead--  or fucking.
you're a son of a bitch.
yeah--cripes.  i never did get any sense out of alice.  she found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  it was a bitch.  you know--maybe mrs. wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if i'd been the paper boy.  maybe not.  i dunno, boy.  that's civilian life for you.  who knows what kills anybody?
for saying "shit." or is that okay now?
no, no--shit no.  excuse me, penelope.
it was a bitch.
he told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
you're going to thank me for this. you know what the media's like. they love this kinda shit. if that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
where is he? where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
so i guess we're both fucked, huh? but at least you get to go to heaven. i don't get shit.
my man. 'pimp.' i split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. i once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'you can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- i bought 'em.' yeah, with my fucking money...
i don't blame you, niki. really i don't. it's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, tv. it's destroying everything. buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. kids think it's normal. they think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
just a second. it's my ass i'm risking. you better do it my way. these fuckers don't mess around.
if you see anything from the inside it makes sense. you ought to hear perverts talk. a guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
i thought i was fucked up.
fuck.
shit.
we're just alike. you think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. i think sex is so unimportant i don't care who i do it with.
you don't understand shit.
i didn't think so. i've fucked detectives. who are you?
i felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what i did to you -- not that i did anything wrong -- that i kept investigating, poking around. there's some poor s.o.b. in l.a. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
oh, fuck off. you should stay where you belong.
research, my ass. i suppose these are the 'extra expenses' i've been paying for? and in the middle of the morning, too.
no, i didn't think she was. let me get the picture here. let me guess. she was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
who the fuck knows? the four aces. he goes there.
it's cool. why do you think i got in the movies? how much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. you can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. so why fuck with the movie business?
you can fuck off, too.
well, he can just fuck himself.
nope never saw her before.  kurt, come over here. don't use underage kids. wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in mexico.  you recognize this piece of wool, kurt?
harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. you just can't let the world judge you too much.
shit. bull. shit.
i know i don't have to. it's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. o.k.?
i don't know, kyle. you're the fucking expert. now get out of the way!
who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? it's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
you fucking ass-holes.
my fucking hand!
wait! wait! watch the fucking paint work.
stay the fuck away from me.
no, damn you --
shit.
so, what's your problem? let's get to it.  you're not going to change your fucking mind ?
get the fuck out of here.
that's what we want.  reaction.  and if laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  let 'em riot, we can handle it.  we'll be ready.
what do you think?  dick likes it.
like fuck you are.
i heard you, man.  don't give me that "what" shit.  you just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
what the fuck is that?
fuck off, barry.
great!  that's fucking great!  they only asked you to sing because of your name!  you can stick it above the browser racks over there.
they were fucking called that before i was in it, okay?  it wasn't my idea.
what the fuck is that?
suck my ass.
oh come on, rob.  what am i, an idiot? i'm more bothered by dick's thing. how did this happen, dick?  what rational explanation can there possibly be?  what's her name?
because it's a brilliant film.  it's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
-- you're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
oh no, rob, that's not obvious enough. not at all.  dick, did you hear that?
we're only on the fucking list for marie's gig at the pulaski pub, that's all!  all three of us.
bullshit.  the guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  why not have a little fun?  big fucking deal.
barry, i'm fucking broke!  i know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
you just drove a fucking customer away, barry.
yeah, well it's fucking monday afternoon.  you should get out of bed earlier.
that is perverse.  do not tell anyone you don't own fucking blonde on blonde.  what about television?
-- it was dean, you fucking idiot.
holy shiite!  what the fuck's this?
fuck!  i knew it!  you're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
don't worry about it, dick.  barry's an asshole.
-- fuck off!
i understand, dick.
yeah.  i'm sorry... look dick, laura and i broke up.  she's gone.  and if we ever see barry again maybe you can tell him that.
'morning, dick.
i've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
i can see why you say that.  look, i'm sorry.  i really am.  the last thing i wanted was... that's why i left, because... i lost it, and i didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason i fucked everything up was because i was scared.  i just wanted you to know, that's all.
who the fuck's pig?
you know that i can cook my ass off when i feel like it.
well.  sex, i guess.  is sex with him better?
-- i don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
what?  gimme a fucking break.  is that what you think?  that your not big enough a deal for me?  jesus, gimme a little credit, rob.
shit!
-- no, no, no, don't even.  i talked to laura, rob.  i talked to her and she gave me a little background. and you're a fucking asshole.
awhile back, dick and barry and i agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
mom!  for the last fucking time, i'm telling you laura didn't want to get married!  she is not that kind of girl!  to use a phrase.  that's not what happens now.
well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
fuck off.
come on brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
should have seen him the first night.  son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
i mean, no suspenders. they just kinda' disappear up your ass.
come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
whoopie fucking doo.
christ, you scared the shit out of me.
fucking great.
i was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
do you believe this fucking girl?
actually it's g. ober... gerry ober, but the guys drew in the other o, fucking assholes.
yeah, yeah...  ...i like to fuck shit up.
yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what i mean?
well fuck me side sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, god damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, i'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
you see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. you know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
i figured that much. why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
shit, i don't remember exactly. i took over for my pa just after the duke nabbed the oscar.
i know, this is fucking nuts.
didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
whatever, at this point all i care about is food. i'm starving and i got a fucking killer headache.
tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. there's no saving it now.
you're a real fucking piece of work.
fuck. i think we blew a tire.
yeah, no shit i just told ya.  hey, you think this place called alien ed's ufo welcoming center is still around? it says, "where the fact is separated from the fantasy."
shit, we really need to find some gas.
dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty samsonite shit.
yeah, no shit.
yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that i remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  oh yeah, patty pee-pee pants... when ever she got called on by miss chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
lock the fucking doors.
shit, i'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
turn that fucking radio off!
fuck! we are fucked!
yeah, yeah, sure. you don't have to get all true grit all over my ass... i'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all i care.
and i gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... i figured what's the harm. stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
fuck your grandmother.
ya hear me? you bust that crapper and i'll beat your ass.
worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
well, yeah... i think that if you knew him... i mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
christ, ain't they all. all them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
that kid is one horny retard.
the retard over at molly's fruit stand.
shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. i was a fixin' on trading it to jackie cobb.
yeah, jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
fuck, it's freezing.
don't be such a fucking smart ass.
i think i'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
she said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
i think i'm going fucking crazy.
god damn it, i knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
you got to be fucking joking.
i know, that was some crazy shit. i never in a million years would have believed it if i hadn't seen it.
aw, shit...  i gotta pee anyway.
shit, i wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
holy jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
well christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
negative. shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
i know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
this is way too fucked up for words.
god damn it, i must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. hold on for two seconds.
fuck you, you fucking freak!
doing what? messy up your day? well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
go down stairs and play nice... i'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like i always fucking do.
i'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
fuck, go to the car... call for backup. tell 'em officer down.
shit... fuck procedure.
shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
aw, fuck.
hulk was dumb as shit.
you know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
how old do you think i am? i know who the fuck spider-man is. get to your point.
hey, ma. did you bring any clothes? i'm freezing my ass off.
i have some thoughts. i think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
that bitch. i worked so hard. we worked so hard, you and i. he would've made us famous.
shit.  hi, honey.
go the fuck away, rosie.
holy shit. your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
eat shit, thumbtack dick!  thank you, frank. you're the best.
shut up! yeah, this is lila, cunt. and don't let the hirsutism fool you. i know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. i know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
i fucked her! okay? i fucked her. i'm sorry. but that's what the hell i did.
shit.
i had sold my fucking soul.
apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
oh shit, we're late.
dick-weed.
dick-weed!
how to kiss ass.
just take it, dick head.  alicia! make sure he takes his medicine.
...shit! it's just money.
shit! you're in love.
holy shit!
how's that for fucking savoir fair!
you son of a bitch! you conned me!
...fuck is this? fuck!
shit...
the new york times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! you fucked us!
"i'm lowell bergman, i'm from '60 minutes.'" you know, you take the "60 minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. maybe wigand's right. maybe i'm hooked. what am i hooked on? the rush? "60 minutes"? what the hell for? infotainment. it's so fucking useless, all of it.
...you fucked me!
...and i'd be lying to you if i didn't tell you, i'm about out of moves, dick...
no, you give me a break! i never left a source hung out to dry, ever. abandoned. not 'til right fucking now! when i came on this job, i came with my word intact. i'm gonna leave with my word intact. fuck the rules of the game! hell, you're supposed to know me, mike. what the hell did you expect? you expect me to lie down? back off? what, get over it?
but in all that time, mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? lost his heart? walked out on us? not one fucking time! you want to know why?
"put the corporation at risk"...? give me a fucking break!
no shit.
you fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where i am now... staring at the brown & williamson building. it's all dark. except the 10th floor! that's the legal department. that's where they fuck with my life!
that's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! hello...?
what kind of shit is this? i was not on the team, i sparred with the olympic team... okay?
what do you want to do, lowell, look up my ass, too...!
they get to go home at night. what does it cost these people to do this to us? nothing?! my girls are crying, so fuck them! i want to tape! i'm done thinking about it.
no. i did not. big tobacco is a big story. and you got something important to say. i can tell.  but, yes. i did. i came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, i don't burn people.
fuck you, too!
no, you can.  tell him to get on the fucking phone!
alright, now listen to me. i want you -- i want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
i don't know what the fuck i really think! are they doing it? is some crank doing it? are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what i think? i don't know! i don't fucking know.
that was -- oh, shit. what if he's on his way over there?
i want to nail you ass.
that is bullshit! mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. i can't believe you're saying this, marylin! there's nothing wrong with us. we're attractive and charismatic and successful and... i like us.
oh, i'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
see the tape. then we can discuss reconciliation. rex screwed up and i nailed his ass. now i'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. then i'm getting on with my life. that's all i'm after.
shit.
in the words of my private investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
i know that sounds rough but i'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and i'm mortgaged up to my ass. if this deal goes south, i'm ruined -- i'll lose millions.
what the fuck...?
i always lock my files.  and you were the only one here today...  what do you mean, you son of a bitch?
who gives a shit what he calls himself?
photographs - compromising stuff. and he'll use 'em.  the agency plays for keeps...  i knew oswald.  he was in my civil air patrol unit.  i taught him everything.  a "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  i treated him good.  he'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... he got a raw deal.  the agency fucked him.  just like they're gonna fuck me.
i don't have much time.  they don't even need bugs anymore.  they got these fuckin' satellite waves.  they put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  he was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  a nazi rocket scientist father and a commie spy mother.  you'd never believe half the shit the agency does.  i'm so fuckin' tired.  haven't slept since that shit article came out. why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
yeah, you got it.  since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, i'd like an answer from you. did you plant it?
shit!  forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  you know, at one time i even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  and then i lost that. that fuckin' clay shaw.  i hate the bastard.  all i got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  he tipped the newspapers - i know it.  that's how the agency works.  they use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  now it's my turn.
you make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. man, you never leave the agency. once they got you, you're in for life.
fuckin' a.  how do you think the agency gets people to do their bullshit?  fuck knows what they got on oswald!
bring on all the motherfuckers! bring their college degrees in here! i got nuthin' to hide.  they can't buy me.  you can't buy me.  i don't even need the parole.  this is about the truth coming out.  you're a goddamn liberal, mr. garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  fascism is here now, facism is...
fuck, yeah!  i told you so.  and you can tell'em all i told you so.
don't get me started on that.  those warren commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  no one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
like i said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
but the only way to help you was to do that, so i did it.  okay, how 'bout this? after we're through fuckin' with these koreans, i take you to roscoe's chicken and waffles. my treat.
you think i wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but i do it --
fuck that shit, man. i ain't shootin' anybody.
why the fuck you at home? cause i spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  look, i gotta problem. i need help, and you can help me.
that's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
how old is that machine gun shit?
naw, man. they just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
you see, it works like this. you get your ass in trouble, i get your ass out. that's my job. and i don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
who was there for your ass?
what the fuck can i say? i'm serious, man. what the fuck can i say? thank you... thank you... thank you.
i'm tellin' you, i don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
that's my diet shit.
it never was, so i'm not gonna start worrying about it now. look, ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. all he really gives a shit about is getting ordell.
you know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
that's what you do to go through with the shit you start. you rationalize. i can do this, max, i know i can. but i can't do it without you.
he never came home. but i'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- so after a couple hours i think, "what am i doing here? nineteen years of this shit? so i made up my mind, that's it.
my ass ain't the same.
if i get let off. otherwise, fuck 'em.
but if all i can give 'em is ordell's name -- i don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- that don't give me much to bargain with.
i had 'em too. i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down. then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
yeah, but that's not what this was about. they were fuckin waitin' for my ass. they knew i had that money, they even knew the amount. the one who searched my bag, from l.a.p.d., dargus, hardly even looked at it. "oh, i'd say there's fifty thousand here. what would you say?" but all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to customs, and i could tell they didn't want to do that.
shit.
she was more helpful than the fuckin' public defender.  i don't know -- i guess what i need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
that's why i don't quit. if i can't fly anymore, i'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
i imagine shit needs to be done.
no shit. you know how he makes his money?
look, that shit ain't mine.
you planted that shit on me.
what the fuck is that shit?
max cherry? you and him friends now? you tell him about this shit?
she don't know shit about the money.
not when it's my ass on the line you don't. we do this my way or fuck it.
now, hold on there. i ain't pullin' no shit. it's my money, i can do whatever the fuck i wanna do with it.
i know, but i hung around, 'cause i figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
i don't want no more fuckin' surprises. we do this the way i laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
they know i'm delivering for you. i mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- they want you with guns. so i say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
what the fuck's that got to do with it?
well, shit. that don't mean you gotta confirm it!
how the fuck they know that?
shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
the cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
shut your ass up and grab the wall!
i think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
who you think got your ass outta jail?
i mean it. don't say one fuckin' word.
watch it, dipshit. you wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
fuck you. i can carry it.
just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
we shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
wanna fuck?
i went to a few just to meet women. but i don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin loud. during that whole scene i just drank in bars.  who didn't make the cut?
he's just repeating shit he overheard. he ain't any more a gun expert than i am.
oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money i got in the world! let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! the reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
i ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, i'm givin' you reasons.
man, i don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what i'm saying? she wants me to know she ripped me off.
'fore i blow that bitch's brains out, i'll ask her.
fuck you for asking me that.
you sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars i worked my ass off to earn?
look, i swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and i took it from her.
well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. what we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. anybody but that woman.
that's what i gotta tell you. she bugged me the whole time. got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag. started running her fuckin' mouth... i couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "is it this aisle lou- is, is it that one?" she was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. this is my goddam money we're talking about. get your ass out the door.
'cause she my fine little surfer gal. she can't do me no harm. fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. you could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
well, why the fuck keep her around?
she tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
if this is about you fucked melanie, i don't give a damn. i ain't a fool. i leave you alone with a bitch like melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after i'm out the door. so say "thank you" and i'll tell you, "you're welcome."
hell, yeah. to her dumb country ass, compton is hollywood. close as she's ever been, anyway.
then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. i got somethin' to show you.
naw, man. i just told you, i'm comfortable. i ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. you bring your ass out here.
i'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
see, what did i tell you? man in new york wants a 9 millimeter smith and wesson model 5946. why does he want it? it's the gun that nigga on "new york undercover" uses. because of that nigga, i can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
by herself. that big mandingo nigga winston ain't there, is he?
that's why she's givin' up my money huh? not that bullshit about melanie. i didn't trust her ass neither, but i knew how to handle her. she was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. i fuckin' told louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. she's at your office.
my ass be dumb, but i'm not a dumbass. go sit over there on the couch.
how the fuck did he find me?
you know what the fuck i'm talkin' about. you talk to her?
git your ass in here.
you keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
what the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? you lookin' to get shot?
looky here, i know you helped her and i know you know what i want. jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. she do that, we're still friends. now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' louis. and if she tries to turn me in, i'll name her ass as my accessory. we'll go upstate together. hand in handcuffed hand. now that shit's a promise, understand what i'm sayin'? you tell her that, and i'll call you back.
what's up with this shit.
falsely accused of intent. if she had that shit -- and mind you, i said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. jackie ain't no criminal. she ain't used to this kinda treatment. i mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in county fuck with your mind.
if i don't see it in front of me, you're right. it ain't shit.
man, you know i'm good for it. thousand bucks ain't shit.
jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
very first motherfuckin' thing they did. they see i put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. they roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. fuckin' scare my woman, sherona, half to death. she thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
they fuckin' wit' her. they callin' it possession with intent. a black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit intent. same shit happened to a movie star. it's possession.
fella named beaumont. they have him up at county. it started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
c'mon, you know how they do. black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. first off, they gonna wanna know where i got it. second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. fuck that shit, jack. i'll go through you.
ha-ha-ha. i'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. that shit robs you of your ambition.
shit! you know it's not half the case if i go it alone. we're all suffering the same symptoms, frank. the army is to blame. they've done something to us. how can you not want to know?
a doctor? and what's he gonna do, tell me i'm crazy? they've fucked with my head. i've got to prove it. you've got to do something.
the army. the army. what is it with you guys? we're not talking about a trip to the library here. this is the united states government for god's sake. this is red tape coming out of your ass. you know what i mean?
i think something's fucking connect- ed. i mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. doug too, right? we've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
shit!
she said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
that's ridiculous. i've been coming here for years. listen to me. i'm going out of my fucking mind here. i need to see him.
shit! can't i just have a bad day?
you son-of-a-bitch. who do you think you are? i don't deserve this. who takes care of you day and night? who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? well, i've had it. you flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. i'm done holding your hand. i don't want anything to do with you, you hear? nothing!
you're out of your fucking mind. i'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
that doesn't mean shit. where do you come from, huh? and i don't mean indiana.
look at her face. a real bitch.
no shit. they had me by the balls. next thing i know i'm in saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. not the street stuff mind you. they had us isolating special properties. the dark side, you know? they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
they've been followin' me. they're comin' outta the walls. i don't trust anyone. i'm not even sure i trust you. but i gotta talk to someone. i'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
no joke. fuckin' army! that goddamn war. i'm still fightin' it.
shit, paul. i'd love to see you. but i'm kind of laid up here. i've been sick.
paul! you son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? i haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
okay, enough of this shit.
rizzo pull the fucking lever!
shit!
just don't go in there half cocked. you guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
i don't give a shit. this one's prime for decryonization. we're brining her back.
not an option. i'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
look! just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! that's the only way you're going to live.
fuckin a...
roger that.  time to kick some ass!
that sounds like rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
wait around on your asses all day.  i'll need a distraction.
you know, this future shit sucks. i'll fucking do it.
thinking with your dick again, delongpre?
no shit. i got no problem with that.
more time...shit, she's had 400 years...
she broke my fucking nose!
oh, shit. he's going to see us.
close the fucking door!
forget her, she's a pain in the ass. let her hang there.
shit! temp's dropping! we should have left this rock an hour ago!
come on. you got all these gadgets and shit. why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
don't worry about me. i live for this shit.
yes, i've reprogrammed you. you are very brave. bad ass.
i'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a knofflapod. damn.
oh shit! there he is!
get your ass back to the shuttle. i'll check it out.
you son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
that's great. i bet they'll kick jason's ass at a spelling bee!
yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
i used to wear this to the garden. garbage strikes. dog shit. muggers.  ship it.
be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
hello, junior. what are you? some kind of half-assed astronaut?  jesus christ, when i was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. what d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
basically, i'm completely smitten with you, and i don't care if i'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
you know, i've been thinking. i'm really sorry i was such a huge bitch to you. you didn't deserve that. you never deserve any of the poo i unload on you.
shit.  hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
juno? did you happen to barf in my urn? mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one i got up in stillwater? i found some weird blue shit, i mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
shit, yeah. close it up.
this isn't what we agreed on. you guys have to take care of... this! you are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
most fruitful yuki is bad ass, man. you should be proud to be the same condition.
vanessa. shit, you better get out of here.
no shit. like johannes brahms?
yeesh, they sound like a cult. besides, they're greedy bitches. they already have three kids!
maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to cabo san lucas for spring break.
oh my god! oh shit! phuket thailand!
well adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
no, it's all yours. it's on me... for saving my ass back there.
what the fuck is wrong with you brian!? if you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. he is... for real!
wrong! i was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to california... there's a big difference.
oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as i wanted you too.
stop being so fucking melodramatic! if it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
fuck!
bitch, bitch, bitch!
oh, yeah... he had a real thick accent right outta "deliverance."  "still? who said anything about a still? get ya ass up in them woods!"
it's about fucking time, kessler! i'd just about given up on you.
what i'm thinking is, we can drop down through tennessee, across arkansas and into texas, from there it's a straight shot into california.  "we don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
look, fuck the thesis. i think there's a book here. your photographs and my research, together.
just like that. load up the lincoln... point it west... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
no we can't. we can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to california now, right now, before it's too late.
...i know i'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
you sick twisted fuck! you don't know shit about me.
he wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
he's a killer, brian... he's fucking insane.
hell if i know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to texas.
that shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. i like my odor. it's fuckin' natural.
yeah. the other day, some sort of chinese bitch told me i'd look good with muscles.
shut the fuck up.
holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
yeah, good luck. i mean what the fuck. the guy had no legs.
i'm telling you the truth. and after that, i've always givin' my money to retards. because that's the reverse of what he did.
i'll tell you why. because when i was little, i had a fat cousin, cousin luke. and he used to make fun of the handicapped. and one day he had a bad stomachache. so he drank a bottle of pepto and his ass blew off.
whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. you give them money. but if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
that's just it. it's elitist. it's reverse elitism. because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. i notice what you do.
did you look at that guy? what the fuck. he had no legs.  he had no half his lower body. he's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
i don't care motha fucka. i'll bet you money she fucks me.
how are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? that shits gotta be against the law.
i'm gonna fuck her tonight. i swear to god i'm gonna fuck her.
i wanna fuck darcy.
yeah me too nigga.
man i haven't seen her in forever. what the fuck's she up to?
no, i'm serious man. i'm dead ass. do you wanna try? we could be like the fuckin x-rated "wonder twins"!
yeah. the way i see it. my outlook on the this situation is.  it's like getting fame, you know what i'm saying. it's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
i don't know. that's too easy. i mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. that's so easy.
did she suck your dick?
what for? that guys a dick.
hell yeah. fuckin' starvin'. wait up a sec.
shit.
she's probably smash you in the fucking face.
that would be good. but i mean more like. i don't know. like when i was having sex with her, i kept thinking how much i would like to put it in her ass. just to see what would happen.
you mean like fucking two virgins at once.
i mean i'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
i'm telling you casper. i think i'm getting addicted to that shit.
and for a second i felt a little bit guilty. you know, because she's young and all. and then i was like, oh shit, that turns me on. i wanna fuck this little baby girl.
well it took me longer than i thought it would take. it took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. but once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. i had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. it hurts the first time.
how long did you fuck her?
oh shit. how long did it take?
hell yeah. that bitch was bleeding. when i first put it in she screamed real loud. i saw her bite down on the pillow.
she can fuck?
oh my god, so good. that girl can fuck.
i knew you fucked it! i sat out here for like two hours! that girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
you fucked it?
was up bitch?
shit.
don't look for him. he's doing fine. he's gotta girl. he's fuckin' her right now in steven's parents' room. so do ya know joe.
what do ya want with telly? that guy has enough bitches.
i don't know. i just never seen girls that did that shit before. but i think it looks nice.
man we fucked him up.
i don't know. but all i know is that i kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
probably. fuck that, i'll sneak in. i need some female vagina tonight.
i'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
come on bitch. throw your fists up.
what the fuck yo? you wanna catch a beat down?
yeah watch the fuck where you skate. you know what i'm saying?
i like you so much. i think you're beautiful. i think if we fucked you would love it. you wouldn't believe it.
yeah. it'll be nice. it'll be a change of pace. that club shit gets boring.
because i like you. i think you're beautiful. i think if we fucked you would love it. you wouldn't even believe it.
you want to fuck me. but you can't fuck me.
i'm fucking serious. where's telly?
yeah. 'cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
the pain. the fucking pain!
i knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. that dick.
yeah. speaking of stupid shit. him and his ape ass of a friend casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
just a lot of crazy shit.
and you don't get shit out of it.
it's like yeah whatever. but when you fuck. you wanna fuck that person. you're like ripping each other's hair out. ooooh.
yeah. and sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
and the other person i just fucked, which was a mistake. but i went to the clinic last week with jennie.
and i know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so i knew he was safe.
i've known the past of all the people i've fucked without a condom. like i know one of the people got tested and was negative.
yeah. the shit gets wacked. fifteen minutes.
oh shit.
right. you know it's not like... you know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
holy shit. that's all true?
he was like sucking my tits. he was fucking fingering me. but that shit was nice and hard.
and we were like underneath the sheets. we were going at it like crazy. oh my god that shit was so good! it was like hard...
that shit is nothin'. i remember, i had just turned 14. with this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. i don't even remember his name. i think it was john or jake or something. i remember he had a brother named lentil because i would always joke and call him lentil bean. this was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
shit. all right. but don't fuck with anything ok?
come on steven hook me up. do me this solid.  come on man. i gotta get darcy alone. she's gonna let me fuck her man. please.
you set yourself up tonight when you attacked kathy, you crazy fuck!
fuck you!  i'm tired of your goddam accusations!  if you want to arrest me go ahead!  otherwise back off.
i used to.  with my old man.  he taught me how to hunt and trap.  trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  we used to go after raccoons mostly. they'd get into our garbage, our fields.  when an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  but they're crafty little devils.  you see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  you ever smell raccoon scent?  smells like shit, but to a male raccoon it smells just like pussy.  he'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a raccoon and stick his goddam head right in it.  you know why?  cause he can't help himself.  the scent drives him.  so, if you want to catch a raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
no shit!
you couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
don't fuck with us!  where did you go!
it's you who's running out of time. you're starting to make mistakes now. you're wondering just how much i really know.  just how close i'm getting? well, i'm closer than you think, pal -- and i'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
fuck off!
there's no blood.  where's the fuckin' blood?
this stinks!  you want to know what i think?  i think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. you need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
come on, shit, tell me! is he beautiful?
then? you didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  you met anyway?
why? did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  i won't get shocked. i'm used to this!  my father was a true pig. he fucked the bitch i'd as mother all around the apartment. whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  and my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
...shit!!  we'd found him. we waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
yeah, but i don't give a shit about.  i trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
no it's not.  he should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of johnny walker.  he's never been there for me.  i've always been alone.
shit!  he jumped!
if he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses.
and do what... rot away in a room?  we're not going to talk about that. fuck you! i will not talk about that. you're staying here. you are not moving to a hotel.
ah, yes... i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
what i mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. we're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in las vegas?
do you want to fuck now?
that's funny.  i wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
he's an ass that's gonna try.
but is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
he's the top defense attorney in the state. of course he's an ass.
is he always such an ass?
i'm a fraud! but it's not like normal people can have this ass! if my fans knew, i'd lose everything. i've already lost my husband. i rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
that's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- oh, my god...
i couldn't help it! it was the most fun i've had since i've been in law school. not only was i good enough for warner -- i was better than him. he has to see serious i am now. even donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
i'm a bitch.
but the thing is, if i'm gonna be a senator by the time i'm thirty -- i can't keep dicking around.
you don't know what the deal is.  there is no fucking deal.
we haven't build shit.  you're just tearing down your father.
the game was to make me smaller than he was.  no matter what.  he could be almost invisible as a human being, but i had to be smaller.  so if i got good grades, i was a pussy for not playing football.  if i cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  if i shaved it, i looked like a psycho.  i never won the game.  not once. and if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
oh, so you're in the big shit now!  child abuse.  people go to prison for what you just did to me.
you're too fucking late.
i'll apologize for everything but today...today i give a shit.
i've been using since i was twelve! you're all so unbelievably stupid.  you didn't give a shit about anything i did until now!
no goodbye.  no fuck you.  no 'are you in love with george?'
she wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  i mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  she like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
what the fuck?
don't tell me, i don't want to hear it. it's probably all fucked up, anyway.
they oughta tear that shit down and ship them yankees cross the river to jersey.
i'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to new york right now.
i'm sick of watching camp 12 win the championship. every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. this year i want that pig.
how the fuck are we gonna do that, ray?!
he'd be doing me a favor. i'm getting outta here one way or the other! goddamn rats and shit! fuck!
that gripes my soul, man. we're out here in the middle of nowhere. there is shit nibbling at my balls! don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
at least you're honest for once. so now you want to be my friend? well, let me tell you something, claude-my- shit-don't-stink-banks. you got a lot to learn about friendship.
getting a map from a chubby chef named cookie? dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? that ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. when you've got a map to new york city, you get back to me.
no, i don't like it here. look around. there's nothing but ass. male ass! balls and ass! believe you me, i'm getting out of here.
he just blocked it out. nigger's crazy. he's the one who did all the stabbing. he's capable of some heinous shit.  how 'bout him down there?
life?! how long is life? we were just walking back to the truck. we didn't do nothing! fuck life!
spanky's gonna be pissed? poor spanky. fuck spanky! what the hell kind of a name is spanky, anyway? you're responsible for this situation. i blame you for everything. if it wasn't for you, i'd be home having a hot meal right now.
fuck that cheap-ass watch --  i mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
that was mighty charitable of you, claude. looks like we both got fucked tonight.
okay then, i'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
when there is, you can forget about it. and i swear to god, you ever talk about my daddy again i'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
no, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! if they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
i seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. them fellas sizzled up good. looked like some shit from the x- files.  damn, that shit's nasty.
if you fuck me on this one, i'll spare no expense.
you don't have to drown that fella, spanky. you already scared him half to death. he didn't know who he was fucking with.
you work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
the shit has hit the fan, kid. take a look.
we had the greatest afternoon of my life until adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
you can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
look, it's okay for me to shit the street. but you gotta use a toilet.
hey... popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
he's got 'til midnight tonight, nicky.  you get your ass back up there. you save your father!
oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up hitler's ass at four o'clock.
i don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. when it's over, that mood has been altered. wow. great shit. what's next?
your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
okay, now you gone and done it. you done messed with my business bitch!
this rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, carl. whatiya burn in this thing, "v"?

look at all this shit... i know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  we can go anywhere.
how'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
dick can't be dead. who told you he was dead?
he is? i didn't think you knew dick. how do you know he's dead?
but dick laurent is dead, isn't he?
dick laurent?
i don't know his name. he's a friend of dick laurent's, i think.
captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
fuckin' "a".
do you know how many fuckin' car lengths it takes to stop a car at 35 m.p.h.?
he's got some fucked up friends.
her name is alice. you know i love that girl to death. if i ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, i'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... then you know what?...
beautiful! smooth as shit from a duck's ass. let's take a ride.
fuck you!! fuck you!!
what's the bitch's name?!

what the fuck is going on?
where've you got him?  is he all right?  tell me, you fuck -- where is he?!
cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
it's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the chief.  that you think i might, you know, fuck with him, if i had the chance...
they were grabbing her fucking ass --
nightlife. where's the hot ass?
should i fuck him?
holy shit.
i got news for you, horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
and how could you fucking leave horrace hanging?
nobody's fuckin talking to you.
i got news for you, bobby, he don't give a shit.
what the fuck was that about?
tell you the truth, i don't give a shit for me. but that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
good! it'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. he's not fucking driving you!
ho's a fucking pimp! he encourages wendy to turn tricks. and she's his fucking wife!
maxie's fucking with me. he put you with the spook to get under my skin.
i don't give a shit. i work for her. no touching.
i guess inside. or he never made it. either way, i don't give a shit. let's get this over with.
and not a word to maxie. he'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
they ran shit back in the eighties. used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. that's back when the irish was making a play against the italians. i don't know if they still around, but i don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
nah, man. no one is. they got some puerto ricans and a new crop of fuckin irish immigrants.
he must have that shit troughed.
a shot caller. a boss, a capo. he's running shit.
shit.
it's bad. before you even showed up, he said you were maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. he wanted to tcb alone. i was gonna ride shotgun to keep the english dude above board. now he's spooked. this shit's snowballing.
to be honest, man, i don't know shit either. all i know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
don't 'easy ruiz' me. y'all turned a easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  bring me four eggs benedict and a mimosa. you all want mimosas?
jesus christ, where the fuck you been all night? you look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
now that limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. maxie's gonna shit a nokia when he hears about... aw, shit, i better call him before he hears.
holy shit. get me back to manhattan.
where do you get this shit?
this shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with maxie.
i fucking vouched for you. i vouched for you and you fucked me.
i did! i paid for half the fuckin drinks!
it was six in the fucking morning.
i'm tired and i'm scared, and i'm not looking at fucking penguins.
wait a minute. you want to look at fucking penguins now?
i swear to god, i'll fucking puke.
put that shit out...
we're getting ahead of ourselves. we haven't gotten any sleep. let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
what the fuck was that about?
yeah, i know how you do. i know how you do. i've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. you've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. how the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. how you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. who wants to play 'just the tip?' dancing around like a smacked ass. oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak english.
what the fuck's going on?
damn right. bring us two bottles of dom champs and here, take fifty in case i call you bitch later when i'm drunk.  siddown, motherfucker.  'sex and paychecks.'
fuck you. go then. i'm taking the car.
you fucking nuts?
fuck this.
yeah, me too. you're a fucking bull in a china shop.
what do you give a shit what he calls us? he's not our friend. let's just get this shit over with and go home. what's this place we're going to, jimmy?
yo, fuck him, man. calling us guineas...
i detected no vibe other than that ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
missing what? he didn't say shit.
this shit's sketchy. why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
what the fuck is that supposed --
you know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
you just don't fucking get it, do you?
no. tell me. what's so fucking horrible about this gig? you've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on maxie's list, and here we are.
what the fuck do you have to complain about?
what the fuck do you...
fuck...
shit. it's thirty-five cents. you got a dime?
great. on my fucking room.
shit. no new pages. i don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, i don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
see, man. maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. beats cleaning carpets.
holy shit. can you believe this?
no, man. it wrinkles my shit. let's grab a fuckin beer --
maxie says he runs a tight ship. i wouldn't fuck with him.
who is this fucking ruiz?
we're not delivering shit. ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
your first start at db, it's against fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
fuck him.
i still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
i'll beat your ass --
shit. who we kidding? i know i suck, and i held you up for ten rounds --
damn right, i have. you think i like living on fucking yucca? we do a good job on this, we're in.
fuck them.
i do. it's a fuckin persian palace.
so i'm like, 'maybe i'm not on the list cause i'm not a fuckin persian.'
fuck...
did you see that shit? motherfucker.  you let in fucking screech, dude? i'm waiting and you let in screech?
i don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin irish. you heard of the westies?.
ow, shit...
dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. you gotta go and say all that 'red dragon' shit. make him think he's on barretta.
just don't ask me no more shit.
what the fuck, 'red dragon?'
i'm not saying shit to neither of you.
don't drag my ass into this --
i know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. what the fuck you think this shit is? '21 jump street?'  cool out, they're coming back. just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
i've heard you've got the best coke in the states. the shit back home is pants.
no shit?
nah, see, maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. he, you know, he tied in with the club. set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
you think this shit's funny, ho?
because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and i don't like you.
go ahead. open the fuckin things. you should each find fifteen hundred --
that's none of your fucking business.
shut it, man. shut it. tom is a square. he don't but dabble in shit. maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an austrian passbook account.
four mimosas.  you'll love them. so here's the plan. i didn't say shit to maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and i don't want to get him all worked up.
what the fuck was you told? don't talk, right?
far as she knows you're john gotti. now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
what the fuck you think, i wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? yeah you're working. and put down the champagne.
some fuckin guineas he sent me. it's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
yeah. this shit's fucking brilliant. i just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. i gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. it's illegal back home, you know.
i wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. it was just my rep, that's all. and don't shit me now, but did you have that number? tell me.
shit, what else she gonna say?
the bitch was there.
when they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
bet you like that shit.
i can't make out that shit.
thank you. now the negro in the field caught hell all day long. he was beaten by the master he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. if the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. if the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. and if you said to him, "let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "yeah, man, any place is better than this." you've got a lot of field negroes in america today. i'm one.
well, bitch you move too slow.
come on, baby. i don't pay that shit no mind.
man, the name musicians ain't got shit. how you gonna have something? i need a stake, a bundle, a grand. my woman can't afford it my homey ain't got it. how about you baby? what you got?
might be, shit. man, i know this town. i got my own fences. who the hell are you? who put you in charge?
my deal is with rosanna. i knew you guys were up to something. are you two fucking?
i don't know shit about you.
fuck. look at you you won't last a day the shape you're in. unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
fuck, i love mexico. i live like a king down here.
creasy??? where the fuck are you?
her beauty fucks with your mind.
i know you need to please lisa. an ass like that is hard to find. good bodyguards are even harder.
the family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  his father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
[you only give information so you can fuck me.]
[you only fuck me to get information.]
i've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. my wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
she had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and i'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
don't try to get it far down. kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
you know damn well i nearly puke when i look at her. i don't even think she's a real blonde.
you betcher ass, general.
you betcher ass, dad.
so let's haul ass, sergeant.
finest kind. captain forrests say you better haul ass home quick. we got new chest-cutter in our tent.
i don't know. i must have lost my punch. i didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
fuck the stereo. what's that smell?
fuck him. he swings at anything in the dirt. i could strike him out.
no shit! he's good!
fuck you! you know what he did to me?!...
god damn it! i still needed to case that fucking store. it's too risky to show my face now.
not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
you fucking idiot! why do you think i use you?... to be a walking advertisement.
you told antonucci that shit came from me.
it's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. it's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
then where's my fucking car!
well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
shut the fuck up and do what i say!
no. you just do shit for me right now.
what the fuck is going on.
see this. solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. probably worth thirty.
come on russell!...  who the fuck's russell?!
no. actually i think it's fucking crazy, i don't know if i could do it.
why? you like my ass?
don't go reading my lips, man. that's an intrusion. save that shit for the sniper school. comprende?
who the fuck are you, mother teresa?
and why the fuck would you do that for me?
what am i giving up? i'm laid off last year. i'm down to my last unemployment check. i'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
you don't know shit, and i suggest you leave.
first you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... no way.
you talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  shit, i thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "m" word.
whoa! wait a minute, ronnie. hold on. i know it's beautiful here. the sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. but we've got to keep our perspective here. this place isn't real. this isn't reality.
yeah, i could get used to this paradise shit.
shit!
he's not plugged-into the system. he's in the fucking system!
doesn't make sense.  how the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
of course you do.  and the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
of course you do.  and the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
i ain't no fuckin' kike!
one fuckin' year ago i had ta hit you up for train fare. now i can buy the fuckin' train. and i ain't even a fuckin' sicilian!
i came into this world flat on my ass.
their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in sicily.
i ain't mad. i ain't even surprised. but i can't let ya fuck me. on the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, i'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
if he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
a lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. i'm sorry you got hit by it.
oh, god. don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
i do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. be the fuckin' boss of all the other bosses, but we are gonna be our own bosses.
is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
it's just that maranzano's the only bastard i ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the irs. he came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
i'll talk to nucky. get you set up like the fuckin' prince of wales.
they don't give a shit about us!
yeah. so who the fuck does?
shit. when i was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. right, gerardo?
you can't fuck with them. they're heads of families!
you got no fuckin' choice. you might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
money don't mean shit!
so fuck him. i don't care anymore. let him come.
what the fuck does that mean?
you're fuckin' crazy. you're all fuckin' crazy!
i don't fuck my partners.
that's just what i'm sick of. everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! greedy for what you got. a bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
fuck 'em.
i think these rich shits -- no offense bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
you're fuckin' crazy.
holy shit.
oh yeah. mr. by-the-book, stick-up-the-ass, my- way-or-the-highway death. believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> so i need a job. he sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. i'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
let's not kick the nice reaper's ass.
yes! and my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who i was, just like mother. the things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
okay then... are you positive your mother's a bitch?  just kidding.
maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
first off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. i told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. as you can see --
...i mean, doc, the dude is seriously deluded. i said that to him, i said, "if you think i'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
no. i don't know what he wants. but i know i don't like being watched. nobody's ever paid any attention to what i did, and i liked it just fine. where does he get off telling me i disrespect myself?  fuck him. look in a mirror, bozo.
fuck the community.  there was this article my friends and i read. it was "25 signs he's great in bed". it was very fascinating.
holy shit!
didn't need one. we didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. man, the irs... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. nobody wants to argue with the irs.
how many sessions have we had now, doc?  six. and it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. just shootin' the shit.
oh, shit, that's not right.
passed out?  can't hang, huh?  boy, i knew you was a lightweight.  passed out on one funky ass blunt.  they don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, craig.  i never thought i'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  but as soon as i got my check, i was gone.  paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
you know me?  i would've shot his big ass.  hey, willie, how's it going?  still steppin' in dog shit every day?
hey, debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
fuck, what's his name?
that's fuckin' poetic, craig.
whatever you say, man.  i didn't see shit.  the safe combination is 34-5-27. just take it all.
shut up!  fo' i pump this glock in yo' ass!  what did you do wit day-day and roach?
wait here?  so cheeco can bite my ass off?  tell me where it is i'll do it.
the bubble guts.  i'm so nervous it feels like i'mma shit on myself.
big bitches need love, too, craig.
damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  and i'm just trying to keep the peace.  we moved out here to get away from that shit.
naw, them dudes is assholes.  especially that dog - cheeco.  watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  plus, i got something better than a cadillac.
two bullets?  yo' ass ain't changed. back in the day, all i had was a stick.
18-years of chasing dogs and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  i still can't figure that one out.
well bring yo' ass on...
see you later, day-day.  come by after work, i got the john blaze shit for you.
my name is miss ho kym.  day-day just trying to be a smart ass.  nice to meet you, craig.  are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
no, give me my damn money back.  right now, and i don't have no damn receipt neither.
i can't get jiggy with this shit.  where is the damn manager?
hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. thanks for the dog, and the money.  maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
finally you got a bitch, huh, roach?
butterflies, my ass.  i'm about to go home.
try an' hold it, man.  squeeze your ass cheeks together.
i say we go over there and kick their asses.  i can take the little one.
who the fuck is that, day-day?
damn nigga, don't jack the joint.  i didn't even pass it.
bummer, huh?  and friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
look, roach, i know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  but if pinky catches you doing that x-games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  you feel me?
sorry, my ass.
ah damn.  damn.
i don't believe this sugar shit. something ain't right.
shhhh!  roach, shut the fuck up.
what?!  this look like a 7-11 or something?  get the fuck outta here!
what the fuck you looking at?
hey!  i said i'll take your fuckin' ass later.  now get out of here.  you're scaring our company.
the skills are still intact.  now tie his ass up, elroy.
shut yo' ass up.
willie, shut up.  yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  he in the best fuckin' hands in rancho chocomunga, baby!  this my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  ain't that right, nephew?
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
you fucked up.
that's right, i killed him. he fucked up one too many times so i put a bullet in his eye. then i put two more into him just to make sure. now that was somebody i loved.
are you 'fucking with me!?
it's about time i did. i was one of those guys, workaholics. i worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  that's just what i thought i was supposed to do.
what? the end of the world? man, don't give me your mad rap. i'm not a bartender. i don't want to hear it. i raise a family doing this bullshit. do me a favor. get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
fuck you!
goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
you worthless piece of shit! gimme that!
fuckin' a.
frogs. they copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in kuwait, where the fuck are they?
foreigners! fuck!
skate-boarders i don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when i see some pin-head on rollerblades, i get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
i'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. what you got?
keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
i don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
how the fuck do i know?  i don't expect you to believe me.
you're lawyers.  how can you let this shit go by!  look!  this?  nixon can't say this.
yeah?  well, i own the fucking casino.
son of a bitch.
so, what about those watergate clowns, john?  this fuck sirica's crazy. thirty-five-year sentences!  there were no weapons.  right?  no injuries. there was no success!  it's just ridiculous.
dick nixon saying "i'm sorry"? that'll be the day.  the whole suit of armor'd fall off.
christ, we created frankenstein with those fucking cubans.
they went after castro.  in some crazy way it got turned on kennedy.  i don't think the "p" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  it's got him shitting peach pits.
my point exactly!  somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! fucking kennedys get away with everything.  do you see me screwing everything that moves?  for christ's sake!  i did what the new york times editorial page said we should do!  i ended the war, i got salt i with the russians, i opened china!  so why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  because they don't like the way i look.  where i went to school.
sure.  lyndon, jfk, fdr -- i mean, truman cut the shit out of my investigation of hiss back in '48.
goddamn! how long have we had this fucking dog?!  two years, he still doesn't come!  we need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
i don't have time for all this shit!  just handle it, bob!  keep it out of the white house.  what else? kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if i don't see him, threatening to quit ... again.
we ought to fire his whining ass. right now when he's on top.  you know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
they had us bugged.  christ, he had everybody bugged.  yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  that was hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
because he didn't even know about it. the cia never told him, they just kept it going.  it was like ... it had a life of its own.  like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  it just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  two days after the bay of pigs, kennedy called me in.  he reamed my ass ...
dick, you don't have to make a statement.  herb covered it for you.
this isn't a "moral" issue, bob.  we have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  the fbi is filled with people who are pissed that i put gray in and not one of their own.  vietnam, china, the soviet union: when you look at the big picture, bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
fucking hell.
howard hunt is working for the white house?  no shit!  this is goddamn disneyland!  since when?
relax, dick, it's just me ... the desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  i want to go home, dick.  time to go home.
i'm honored, dick, that you've come all this way out here to virginia to visit us at last.
thank you for coming, dick.
so, does tricky dick know about this?
you're fucking me.
how the fuck did you know?
let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
well, goddamn.  are you threatening me, dick?
because if you're uncomfortable with the epa up your ass, try the irs ...
i mean i got federal price controls on my oil.  the ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  and i got your epa environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
jack, we're not living in the same country you and i knew in '46.  our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  we can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  hell, the arabs and the japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
so, what's this about, dick?
that sonofabitch kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
dick, these boys want you to run.  they're serious.  they can deliver the south and they can put texas in your column.  that would've done it in '60.
hell, kennedy's pissed cuba away to the russians.  and he don't know what the hell he's doing in vietnam.  these are dangerous times, dick, especially for business ...
all kinds of shit would come out. like the ellsberg thing.  you knew about that, henry, didn't you?
that's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... you tell me, ron, how the hell i can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
fuck it!  he doesn't like me, john!  it's your fault, henry.
you're doing the right thing, dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
this isn't '48, dick.  they'll never buy it.
shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  cronkite's sticking it to me. it's their first big hit on richard nixon.
you need her, dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
make some money, dick, prove yourself to the wall street crowd and let goldwater and rockefeller take the fall against kennedy.
let's get out of here it's too painful.  i hate it.  we went bowling last weekend.  next weekend we're going to the zoo. whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
rocky's full of shit!  no way he's going to get nominated west of the hudson with a new wife.  he's gonna be drinking scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the republicans.
sorry, dick.  she's a little tipsy.
and dick beat the shit out of them.
hi, i'm dick nixon.
... but it depends on what i'm doing to the music, dick ...
no, we don't!  you're full of shit! you say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  my brother died over there last november.  why?  what good was his death?
shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  gandhi, lenin ...
you don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  does it matter what's on them? really? ... murder, dick?  sex?  your secrets, your fantasies?  or just me and you and ...
thank you?  dick, sometimes i understand why they hate you.
i'm the only left, dick.  if you don't talk to me, you ...
whatever it is you've always been hiding.  you're letting it destroy you, dick.  you won't even ask for help.  you're destroying yourself, dick.
not for the pentagon it isn't.  i'm kissing mao's ass.  and the press is gonna find some way to shaft nixon on this one.
i was thinking tonight -- do you remember, dick?  do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  you didn't want to let me out of your sight.
i asked him, "lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  and he said, "bomb the shit out of hanoi, boy!  bomb them where they live." ... john, do you think i was too soft on tv?
do you really want this, dick?
they've lost a brother.  you know what that means, dick.
dick, you should call bobby.
we can be happy.  we really can.  we love you, dick.  the girls and i...
dick, don't...
it's over, dick.
you're not a failure, dick.
we don't have to put ourselves through this again, dick.
well, that's wonderful.  so get me this "crisis" thing, dick i'll be glad to take a look at it.
sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. aren't you exaggerating a bit, dick? call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
someday, dick.
repartee, dick -- very good.  hey, i feel ten years younger!  it makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! how's the lawyer life?
oh, happy!  dick nixon ... you remember him.
you think this boy moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
what is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
no, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! you don't send your best...
fuck you, roy ostrey!
ah, shit... do i have to hear this now?
good god... they're meat eaters, roy, just drop the shit in there!
mind your own business. you just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
uh-huh.  anyway, i'm thinking easter, 'cause i just fucking love pastels.
you know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
wait. let me get this out.  i like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. i read passionately, and i like to discuss things. i'm basically conservative, but flexible. i've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but i can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
damn, life is strange. i had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- not that i didn't admire you for it.
stop calling me that! my name is not david, and if you really don't know the difference, you're more fucked up than i thought you were!
hey, the fda screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  anyway, 'least i try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
no, i do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new buicks?
on television!!  cut the shit, will you!
what are you talking about? this bar is packed with professional people!  everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... luckily, i'm currently off men, so i've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
the fuck you talking about?
driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
you're not a dumb fuck, are you, del?
i'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
it's to follow my instincts. and my instincts say get the fuck out of dodge.
leave. take this shit back to detroit and get the rest of our money.
i do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
...crazy! no shit, shaft!! and you ain't far behind...
fuck the profile! that's the same guy!!
what in the...  what the hell is this? you've been holding out on me. all this fucking time!
"it's beneath her..." she's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
i call it 'nutty' as my shit after i eat almond roca...
i'm not telling 'til you straighten up. you been acting like fucking jerry lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your betty... i mean it.
do you hear yourself right now...? like a fucking madman...
what? what does she represent?! what could some cornbread white bitch from kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the louisiana purchase possibly mean to you?!! i'd just love to know...
i'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
and turn that fucking music off!
let's get out of here. we got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where i do not know, but i know it's gonna be long.
thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  what time're they coming?
oh, for chrissakes. it just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
so what the fuck's a finn?
yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. she's an amateur, just like del was.
...i know i am. let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
i like 'em small. when you're inside a little asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
why would i give a shit how you feel. and i got news for you. i loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... i'm toying with the idea of killing david ravell off in a boating accident.
you fucked it up. who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? and i don't care what her problems are. she wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. we have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
oh fuck...
know him? we were gonna get married! he was gonna leave his wife for me! fuck!!...
that's right! we ain't really negroes!
ass right.
what did you call her? what did i hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
okay, i wrote those things... and yeah, i had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, i saw who she was. i'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
who?  aw shit, zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
great ass.
fuck, no! why would i care about something as dumb as that?
zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
why the fuck didn't you invite me? i would've come.
zack, you little shit! you haven't changed a bit!
hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
what're you waiting for, mayo? get your scuzzy ass up here.
not a fucking chance, asshole!
no you're not. you're failing the big one, baby, and i don't just mean in here. i mean in life. i've watched you, mayo, and you don't mesh. you grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
no way. i'm so happy i'm about to bust. here, honey. this is for you. it cost me my whole savings, but i said what the fuck.
no more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  don't you ever feel used, paula? don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
far fucking out! i've been wanting to meet one of the blue angels since i can remember.
you little bitch! how could you? was there ever a baby, lynette? that's all i want to know! did you make up that baby, lynette? did you??
come on, paula! you were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! or the class before that!
where's that coming from? i wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
you want me to fuck you? is that it? okay, come here. take your clothes off. get into bed.
hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
doesn't mean shit. get her to a doctor. you can't do anything until you hear what he says. make the appointment yourself.
talk to me in the morning. i feel like shit.
my girl back home. we're supposed to get married after i get my wings. she was tommy's girl. they were engaged to be married before he died.  i should've told you about her. i don't know why i didn't, except i didn't want you to think i was a shit for making it with lynette.
fuck you, i'm gone!
she's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  the fuck you had to bring a gun for?!
we've got the kid!  we've got your kid!!  what the fuck is she thinking?!
who the fuck breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
get the fuck away from me.
let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
she's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  she just killed her own kid!
who's the clown now?  huh?!  who's the fucking clown now?!
fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. drives his german car up to 125th street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  you don't know one thing about me!
the fuck did you do that for?!
so what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
who else but god could think this shit up?  i spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now i gotta figure out how to get in.  god, man, he just loves the irony.
what the fuck is funny about this?
you're fuckin' a we can do this.
close?  are you insane?  we're nowhere near close!  fuck this, i'll make an anonymous phone call on monday, they'll find the floor safe, and i'll inherit the shit.  little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
shit!
the fuck did you bring a gun for?
fuck!
fuck.
what is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  you're a bus driver, "homes," you live in flatbush, so please don't start spouting some elmore leonard shit you just heard because i saw that movie too,
no, you will not, because without burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as i'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
no fucking way.
hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  did you see any sugar in here?  any candy bars, anything sweet?
get the fuck out of my house!
"get the fuck out of my house."
fuck.
say fuck.
fuck her too.
fuck him.
fuck that, we've got company...
oh shit alma... you're...
free? we're back where we started. shit we still don't have a stop light.
what the fuck?
brimmer you're fucked up...
go! run! go on! get the fuck out of here!!
fuck how they operate. just do it. like your man says, "by any means necessary."
do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. do you fucking understand?  i want you to move your ass outta neutral. i want a bunch of panthers served up on a fucking plate. i want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
get out of the fucking car.
are you fucking with me? you smartass piece of shit...
spontaneous my ass!! you told the press and you don't tell me. remember you're working for us.
shit man. it was... you know spontaneous.
aaaah, bitter motherfucker... i almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
no fuck you!!!
man, fuck you!!!
man... fuck you. why you always bustin' my balls? all that high and mighty militant shit. i ain't doing nothing.
shit, i ain't doing nothing. white bread asks for cocaine, i take his money. shit... you know... it was just a hustle.
sabu, what the fuck you doing? ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
cy... cy... oh shit man... who did this to you. was it the pigs?
shit, nothing but paper panthers.
huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
man, this shit's pretty thick.
hey, gi bill pays for school. and shit, if i stuck around here, instead of signing up, i'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking bitter dog with rose, you know?
mind if i ask you something? why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
yeah... you were a lot of help with those guns. your soldier shit is bad- ass.
shut the fuck up!!
fuck is up?!
s'alright. i'm sorry too. shit, i gotta take a leak... pull over at that gas station.
just the legit shit.
fuck maybe... be there.
yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
judge... i... i shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
unh... unh man... i don't take no money from friends that need help. fuck no. what do you think i am a bum?
well, i think michael mcdowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
shit! look at this mess!
poor missy. god, i was sorry to hear. i remember when she was no older'n ellen there, walking down to the store with her raggedy anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. i don't know why god takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
for ellie's birthday, yes. i didn't go because her old man thinks i'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. jud, what's this about?
to be brutally honest with you, susan, as long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot o'brien, i don't give a rat's ass about what happens after that.
you mean besides kicking your ass?!
why don't you just shove it up your ass!  haw-haw!
oh shit, the meltdown.  it's spread to the tower.
victim my ass!  you stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
an ass-beating.  would you like yours first, mr. sim?
okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. where's that remote control?
what about her? you didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
i don't lie, jack. i'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. pretty thin, i work out. my pussy's shaved. my friends say i'm pretty cute, so....
yeah....? so...jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
iiiiiiiiiii don't want to hurt anything ever, but what i'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. to take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. fuck. i don't know. i don't know. and you, you.....i'm looking at you and i just....your face is so beautiful i just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.

you just told me to fuck off. that wasn't good. you're dead.
you better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.

you go fuck yourself. you go fuck yourself. you go fuck yourself. my love was hurt, she got hurt. i am in love with her and you hurt you and you are gonna fucking get hurt. you don't touch her, i love her.
i haven't even told you what's happened. your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- dean go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
i said calm down and shut the fuck up. what's your problem?
why don't you shut the fuck up?
hey. you made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. it's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the atm and get your money out --
i fucked her countless times! in every orifice! and all the while, she plead for more --
i wanted to fuck her, that's all!
for fuck's sake, abbe! what am i to do? police my readers as you police me? suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? would you condemn the bible? i think not!
and my chaise -- am i being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
"what shall i ready?" asked fanchon. "my mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
fuck you, mr. kane.
tough shit. we need to t-t-talk about this--
nailed us, hub? the crazy old man and his whore.
this is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
shit
i told you this was going to happen! i told you he was going to come after us! so we took the chance anyway and we lost. that's how it goes, okay? i got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
i don't give a shit about-
fuck you.  you wanted me out. i'm out.
i can't do it. okay?! i drink too much -- i drink all the fucking time and i don't have it anymore. all that is over for me--
fuck you--

i don't know what you expected with joseph- fucking-conrad for chrissake. i mean this is hollywood, pal.
take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
i'm gonna kill him. that fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. you got any money?
none of your fuckin' business.
you fuckin' worm, if you're going out, i'm going out.
i gotta go. i gotta get outta here. i can't take this shit. lenore is waitin' for me. i gotta go. you're a definite wacko. you're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
did you ever fuck my wife?
did you ever fuck my wife?
you're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... you wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
some things changed between us. now, he thinks who the fuck he is. he's been passing certain remarks that i don't like.
did salvy fuck vickie?
what the fuck they want? i took the dive. they want me to fall down too? i don't fall down for nobody. i never went down in my life. joey, what do i gotta do? crawl on my hands and knees? i made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' garden! all the newspaper writers make fun of me. i'm the bum of the year. all i want is a shot. just a fuckin' shot. what do i gotta do? i'll do anything.
say what you gotta say. don't be a smart ass.
jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! what did i do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
they robbed us! those fuckin' judges -- what the fuck fight were they watching? if i see them on the street, i'll break their heads. decision robinson, my fuckin' ass! those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! how else could this have happened?... what do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
ah, some piece of ass, i'm tellin' you.
you sure you wanna meet her? don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. she's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
hey, i don't care about tommy como. i don't care about jesus christ on the fuckin' cross. i gotta give them a percentage of what i make! i'm in here breaking my ass, not them. don't ever bring them up here again.
and that hard-on, salvy. who's he think he is? i'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
don't ever bring those kids up here again! i'm working out, i'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
what was that for? i know you can take punches. i can hit you from now to doomsday. what the fuck does that prove?
you're the fuckin' animal! you ran around with every guy i knew while i was breakin' my ass for you.
get the fuck outa here. whadda you mean nothing'? you stupid bitch!
you're a fuckin' liar.
come out of there! did you fuck salvy?  answer me. open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  who've you been fuckin'?
what's that kissing on the mouth shit?
tryin' to get this fuckin' tv to work. paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. and mr. wizard here ain't no help.
look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' romeo around here. did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
fuckin' kid! you're the best fuckin' fighter around. loved what you did to satterfield. them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. they're all afraid to fight you.
i'll suck your eyes out! i'll fuckin' take the two of you.
what do you think, i'm blind? my brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
-- till he fucked his parole --
you were screaming you weren't nick! and we just didn't fucking believe you!
where's the fucking cash, nick!
there went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. i gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
well, shit, judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
i'm not nick!  you thought you'd fuck him over?! well he's fucked you! i've never worked at some casino! i can't help you! because he's not me!
what the fuck is going on.
fifty percent off, motherfucker. ho ho ho.
what kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
what the fuck are you talking about.
you wrote ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working christmas eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. and the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. that a true story now?
that right? shit. i used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. you ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
there anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
fuckin' freezing.
what you gotta worry about first is the guards. place doesn't look much richer than when i worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. there'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. eyes in the sky. they see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
fuckin, zookerman --
hell, you never needed to convince ashley you were me. just the dumb fucking truckers. i figured i'd talked enough about the tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
oh, fuck, rudy... oh jesus...
no, i'm through with that shit. ashley's right. gotta start doing something i got a stake in. get a business going.
fuck your hot chocolate, rudy.
yeah. fuckin' christmas.
fuckin' christmas, man. fuckin, christmas on the outs.
you don't hafta lift shit. you don't really work there. but as far as the records are concerned, you do. i call up matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. you're on the schedule. you got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. and ya know dock workers don't do too bad. so you can move into a halfway decent place without scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." and if scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. that day we sent you to tustin. we gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. you're at the taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
he is a motherfucker. he won't let me leave the halfway house till i get some piece of shit job.
scagnetti? oh shit, i hear he's a motherfucker.
i might break you, nice guy, but i'd make you my dog's bitch. you'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy t-bone hound.
no, you'd keep me for yourself. four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
you fuckin' wish.
no. that your head's been up your ass. i walk through the door and joe says "vic, you're back, thank god. finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. vic, vic, vic, eddie, my son, is a fuck up." and i say "well, joe, i coulda told you that." "i'm ruined! he's ruining me! my son, i love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  i'm not tellin' tales out of school. you tell 'im joe. tell 'im yourself.
i'm sorry man, i shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. this whole week's just been crazy. i've had my head up my ass the entire time.
stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
it makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
a snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. i'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. no, where's mr. brown and mr. blue?
jesus christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. i got a few questions of my own, ya know.
no shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
let nice guy set you up at long beach. give ya some cash, get that scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
what the fuck was that chick's name? oh this is just great, i'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
i was in the sixth grade when that show was on. i totally dug it. what the fuck was the name of the chick who played christie love?
go ahead and laugh, you know what i mean. what a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. they got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
would you stop it with that shit! you beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the chicago fire. that don't necessarily make it so. okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? please tell me somebody brought something with them.
so he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
what the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. and i'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
i gotta memorize all this shit?
fuckin' a. i tell it real good, too.
where i was from, who i knew, how i knew nice guy, had i done time, shit like that.
when you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. they're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. if you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's charles bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. drops 'em right to the floor. everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. freaks everybody out. nobody says fuckin' shit after that. you might get some bitch talk shit to ya. but give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. watch her shut the fuck up. now if it's a manager, that's a different story. the managers know better than to fuck around. so if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. so what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. if you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. the little one. then you tell 'im his thumb's next. after that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. i'm hungry, let's get a taco.
well, what i wanna do is go back to work. but i got this scagnetti prick deep up my ass. he won't let me leave the halfway house till i get some piece of shit job. my plans have always been to be part of the team again.
fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
how's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
not wrong, dumb ass, wong! you know, like the chinese name?
it hurts. it hurts her. it shouldn't hurt. her pussy should be bubble-yum by now. but when this cat fucks her, it hurts. it hurts like the first time. the pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. hence, "like a virgin."
oh fuck, toby's that little china girl.
hey, fuck all that, i'm making a point here. you're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
toby... who the fuck is toby? toby... toby... think... think... think...
jesus christ, joe. fuckin' forget it. this is beneath me. i'm mr. pink, let's move on.
nobody's trading with anybody! look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! listen up mr. pink. we got two ways here, my way or the highway. and you can go down either of 'em. so what's it gonna be, mr. pink?
yeah, mr. pink sounds like mr. pussy. tell you what, let me be mr. purple. that sounds good to me, i'm mr. purple.
whatever. just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  see what i'm dealing with here. infants. i'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
he was the only one i wasn't a hundred percent on. i should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when i wasn't a hundred percent. but he seemed like a good kid, and i was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
you don't know jack shit. i do. this rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got mr. brown and mr. blue killed.
joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. he's a good kid. i understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. we're all real emotional. but you're barking up the wrong tree. i know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
that piece of shit. workin' with the cops.
what the fuck are you talking about?
blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
i'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it joe i'll give it back when we leave.
what the fuck do you think you're doin'? give me my book back!
give me this fucking thing.
i don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
and i'm dying. they don't know that. all they know is they're not to make a move until joe cabot shows up. i was sent undercover to get cabot. you heard 'em, they said he's on his way. don't pussy out on me now, marvin. we're just gonna sit here and bleed until joe cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
what the fuck are they waiting for? that motherfucker cut off my ear! he slashed my face! i'm deformed!
shit. i don't remember that at all.
because this guy's a fucking psycho. and if you think joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off i am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
hardy-fuckin-har. what did he say?
you talked to nice guy eddie? why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
uhuh, uhuh, what's i tell ya? that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
bet your sweet ass we are.
all this blood is scaring the shit outta me. i'm gonna die, i know it.
hey, just cancel that shit right now! you're hurt. you're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
look, i ordered coffee. now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. when i order coffee, i want it filled six times.
no, i can't. you know what i heard the other day? "heartbeat-it's lovebeat," by little tony defranco and the defranco family. i haven't heard that since i was in fifth fuckin' grade.
yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
who cares what your name is? who cares if you're mr. pink, mr. purple, mr. pussy, mr. piss...
i'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
fuck sides! what we need is a little solidarity here. somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. now i know i'm no piece of shit...  and i'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  and i'm fuckin positive you're on the level. so let's figure out who's the bad guy.
then. that time has passed. right now, mr. blonde is the only one i completely trust. he's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
enough! you better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. we're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
you wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? take a shot!
that fuckin did it!
don't fuckin' patronize me.
we had just gotten away from the cops. he just got shot. it was my fuckin' fault he got shot. he's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. i swear to god, i thought we was gonna die right then and there. i'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, i'm gonna take care of him. and he asked me what my name was. i mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. what the fuck was i supposed to tell him, "sorry, i can't give out that information, it's against the rules. i don't trust you enough."? maybe i shoulda, but i couldn't.
he scared the fuckin' shit outta me. i thought he was dead fer sure.
look, asshole, i'm right! somebody's a fuckin' rat. how many times do i hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
thank god, we discovered in time. we hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. just walked away from it.
no shit?
i swear to god i'm fuckin' jinxed.
no, they're not in the car. no, i don't have them on me. ya wanna go with me and get 'em? yes, we can go right now. but first listen to what i'm telling you. we were fuckin' set up! somebody is in league with the cops. we got a judas in our midst. and i'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. but if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
what you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. a psychopath is not a professional. you can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. i mean, jesus christ, how old do you think that black girl was? twenty, maybe twenty-one?
that's the way i look at it. a choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. but i ain't no madman either. what the fuck was joe thinkin'? you can't work with a guy like that. that motherfucker's unstable. what do you think? do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
look, enough of this "mr white" shit -
what the fuck am i doing here? i felt funny about this job right off. as soon as i felt it i should said "no thank you", and walked. but i never fucking listen. every time i ever got burned buying weed, i always knew the guy wasn't right. i just felt it. but i wanted to believe him. if he's not lyin' to me, and it really is thai stick, then whoa baby. but it's never thai stick. and i always said if i felt that way about a job, i'd walk. and i did, and i didn't, because of fuckin' money!
i haven't had a chance to think. first i was just trying to get the fuck outta there. and after we got away, i've just been dealin' with him.
this is so fucked up. somebody fucked us big time.
how the fuck do you think? the cops shot him.
oh that's just fucking great! where's brown?
fuck all that.
you don't have any idea what you're talking about. these people bust their ass. this is a hard job.
ha! right bitch!
well, actually, we've never met officially, but i bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. i said, "i'm sorry," and you said, "watch it, white bitch, or i'll put my size eight in your ass." i thought how cool. i wear a size eight, too. anyway, this is my best friend, cindy.
now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? i hope she didn't see me.
you better be careful. i heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  hey, what class do we have next?
shit!
didn't i just say that? fucking listen. anyway, i did it all for carolyn. he never appreciated her, but i worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. so, i came back for you. just like i did for carolyn.
yeah, bitch, give me my apple. what's gotten into you?
that's it. i'm gonna put my food in your ass. i should warn you, i'm a black belt in karate.
i came as fast as i could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. if i tickle my ass before...
oh shit, you gonna take that?
no, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask jesse jackson.
"fucked me."
"fucked me."
"fucked me."
0h, shit!
what a bitch!
i'm so happy i could shit.
no i don't, you bitch!
did you see her?! she just said "fuck you" to me!
pussy-willows, dottie!
are those pussy-willows?
fuck you!
well, dottie, how come they're not here then, fuck-face?
let me check the zip - 212 fuck you?
you bitch!
isn't this 4215 pussy way?
john and cynthia have been... "fucking".
yeah, i know. i mean, i'm not saying i know people think you're a bitch, i'm saying i know what you mean. and i don't even know that people think you're a bitch. do they?
you bitch. i knew it.
you son of a bitch!!
goddammit, goddammit!! that son of a bitch!!  well, at least i know you didn't fuck him.
for god's sake, ann, i am not fucking your sister. i don't find her that attractive, for one.
ann, you are completely paranoid. not ten minutes ago i wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like i'm dipped in shit. you know, i think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
jesus christ, where'd that come from? i have a late lunch by myself and now i'm fucking somebody?
that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
besides, even if i decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
well, they must be something sexual, because ann gets freaked out by that shit. are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
shit, after what you've told me, i don't know. i should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
sure. maybe he's the man i'm looking for. then i won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
your keys, asshole!! your two fucking keys!! give them to me!!
the fuck was that?
i liked it when you caught me fucking him.
i picked him up and i fucked him. i'm a bad girl.
you picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
you don't think i fuck you, bitch? i'll fuck you.
you said you loved me! you fuck! i hope you die!
no shit. we just had a drink with her last night. miles knows her.
no, not whatever. you fucking derelict.
what the fuck!
what the fuck!
fuck you. i'll get it myself.
horny as shit. flopping around like a landed trout.
so what the fuck were you thinking?
fucking-a it's five clicks! at one point i had to cut through an ostrich farm. fuckers are mean.
her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and i'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
fucking chick's married.
you're joking, right?  what are you doing? un-fucking- believeable. can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
gonna fuck that up too. i should sue her ass. only reason i won't is to protect christine.
you told him. i'm fucking hurting here.
don't need a lecture. you fucking told maya, didn't you?
just stop, okay? make something up, and that's what happened. whatever you want. write my confession, and i'll sign it. just stop pushing me all the time! i can't take it! you're an infant! this is all a big party for you, but not for me! this is serious. and you -- just... leave me alone, okay? you're fucking me up.
you're kidding, right? tell me what happened, you fucker, or i'll tie your dick in a knot.
they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. i guess i'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
being with stephanie has opened my eyes. she's not uptight or controlling. she's just cool. things are so easy with her. smells different. tastes different. fucks different. fucks like an animal. i'm telling you, i went deep last night, miles. deep.
what the fuck are you doing?
oooh, i see. didn't go so good last night, huh? that's a shocker. you mean getting drunk and calling victoria didn't put you in the mood? you dumb fuck. your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
stop it. you are blowing a great opportunity here, miles. fucking maya, man. she's great. she's cool. she's funny. she knows wine. what is this morose come-down bullshit? these girls want to party. and what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, vouvrays? i mean, come on!
okay! fuck!
if anyone orders merlot, i'm leaving. i am not drinking any fucking merlot!
cute? she's a fucking hottie. and you almost tell her i'm getting married. what's the matter with you?  gotta love it. gotta love it.
stephanie, holy shit. chick had it all going on.
because i knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. but then i figured here would be the best place to tell you. we're here to forget about all that shit. we're here to party!
yes they are. and i'm serious. do not fuck with me. i am going to get laid before i settle down on saturday. do you read me?
i am going to get my nut on this trip, miles. and you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
fuck you.
jack, she's a fucking waitress in buellton. how would that ever work?
doesn't mean shit. when christine was a hostess at sushi roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. think it worked? fuck no. how do you think i met her?
well, i say fuck that. you need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
well, i say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, xanax?
fuck, man. too early in the morning for that, you know what i mean?
but you wanted to fuck me first.
who me? nah, i'd just fuck them up. that was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
you fucking bastard! lying piece of shit! you're getting married on saturday? what was all that shit you said to me?
okay, this guy is trying to scare us. he's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. it's time for an ass whoopin'!

do you have any idea how much i like fucking you?
you behave as though you want to fuck her.
you want to fuck her?
fuck me.  i knew it.
get away from me... get away!  she means that much to you, you stay with her.  but you come back, you come back for me.  not for tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
d'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
c'mon, don't make an issue of it. do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
i don't know that ellie.  he might get out.  garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
what shit, honey?
oh, some shit.
you got a great ass!  i love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
i just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
my ass is falling.  it is.
my ass if falling.
if she identifies him.  where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  venza was meat.  he walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  you better hope she identifies him.
no one-seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  he told me not to tell anybody, to bring claire and come alone!  he won't wait, he knows i'm two minutes away!  koontz, please!
it was my fault, t.j.  fuck!
shit!  a nursemaid!  my first detail, and i'm a fuckin' slug!  i got a 'choice' at all.
bad fuckin' news.  even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  but he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  it'd cap it for garber if he could bring him in.
what the fuck you doin'?!
don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
i don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  i can't print this surreal garbage!
i like enthusiasm.  that's why i use a lot of smart-ass kids.  not just 'cause they work cheap.
... damn!
let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... so that, as they say, is that.  damn.
your use of language has altered since our arrival. it is currently laced with -- shall i say -- more colorful metaphors: "double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
top level review, my ass. there'll be no cover-up of this. not after i get...
they're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but i wouldn't trade having them for anything.
oh shit!!!
if i ever run into that guy, i'm going to kick his ass.
you shit! i'll decide if i go or not. not you. i don't know what you do on your planet, but i didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
shit!
shit... shit... what shit?
shit?
shit.
hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... you want my opinion, it's the girl. she had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.

hey, fuck you, man.

yeah.  pretty zany, huh?  all this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  hey... nothing means nothing. you know that.  look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  you gotta take what you can, while you can.  cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
and who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
i know.  so, i'm working for this puke, right?  and he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. but also i gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
you know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  shit being number one.
give him the tape.  see?  it's fucking brilliant!  the tape for faith.  i know he'll go for it.  i can set it up.
mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  they'll see the fucking smoke from canada.
thanks, buddy.  see... things weren't bad enough.  they weren't fucking bad enough!
you should feel like shit.
i was gonna tell ya.  hey, it's just a job.  i feel like shit about it.
d'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
you see the look on that preppy puke's face?  fuckin' pissed in his topsiders.
well... the guy's fucked up.
ha!  that's for fucking sure.
sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. nothing happens.  i'm snorin'.
fuck that!  the last part's the best.  you dry-dive six stories and blammo!  jack right into the big black.
yeah, right.  fucked.
deputy commissioner palmer strickland.  the sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  his ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  i know this guy.  if there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.

shit!
no shit.  you got someplace in mind?
i've had it.  no more wirehead shit in my car.  you understand?  you want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
i've had enough of this shit.  you're on foot, lenny.

me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
lenny, this shit's illegal.
of course. he knows everything about dick low.
you're as crazy as he is! he's right! you don't give a damn about saving lives at all! fuck you!
dick low's a killer too.
listen to this guy? can you believe this? he'll never change. born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
you are so fucked up.
that's because he's a fucking wacko. never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. what's he doing now?
this is some serious shit.
they sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
bitch! cunt! please, please, please don't do this, agent kulok. you need me.
mydick. as in my dick. that was his screen name.
hope you never do. at first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
agent mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
"attitude adjustment issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
shit.
no... maybe that's not the case. maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
yeah, i'll tell her i don't remember and then i'll ask what she looks like.  then i'll ask if we fucked. how's that, tee? is that "the money"?
...piece of shit. listen, charles, this is my friend rob from back east.
...the red piece of shit over there...
because you left, man. she's got her own world to deal with in new york. she was a sweet girl but fuck her. you gotta move on. you gotta let go of the past. the future is so beautiful. every day is so sunny out here. it's like manifest destiny man. i mean, we made it. what's past is prologue. that which does not kill us makes us stronger. all that shit. you'll get over it.
how am i doing well? i host an open mike and i played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. big fuckin' deal. i'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. how good am i doing?
he's a mean dude. i've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. he knocked out his teeth... blood... he was just like boom, boom, boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. he's a nice guy though.
don't sweat it, man. i needed a kick in the ass. we're better friends for it.
we ran into them that night at roscoe's. tee cleared it up, i apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. they fuckin love tee. that boy can talk.
...whatever. you're like a whining little woman. big deal. you got a fuckin' number. whoopee! you'll fuck it up...
what about you, mikey? at least i got balls. you're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
he's a bitch. he ain't gonna do nothing.
you should play another team. the kings are bitches in this game.
hey sue. gretsky's on his ass again.
you little bitch!
you were off your ass back there! where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?

"age of enlightenment". shit. like some waitress in a las vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure french philosophical reference. how demeaning. i may as well have just said "let me jump your ignorant bones."...
that's what i'm telling you, baby. the babies love that stuff. they don't want all that sensitive shit. you start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. they know what you want. what do you think? you think they don't?
that was so fuckin' money. it was like that "jedi mind" shit.
don't give me that shit. you know exactly how much you lost. what'd you drop?
the trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
who's fucking around? i'm not making fun. let's do it, baby.
don't make fun, i think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
i'm telling you, they love that shit.
cut that shit out.
this is fuckin' post-pubescent disneyland.
i took out three hundred, but i'm only gonna bet with one. i figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. you gotta be cool though.
no, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
trent, i don't feel like going out tonight. i got shit to do tomorrow...

well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. and then the spray perfume. you know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!

you think you're cool, don't you? you think you know what's really happening, don't you?  well, you don't know shit, buddy.
i've got six dead norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  now fuck off!
why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
we should have jumped his ass.
oh, shit!  well, hang on!
how the fuck do i know?!
yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  he gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. and they get into one hell of a brawl...
childs, you got the torch?  you get your ass in here!!
look, if you're going to keep bitching, macready -- palmer's offered to take him up...
position, my ass...
i don't give a shit about your patient!

i don't know what you're talking about, man. i swear. this is some weird shit you're telling me... and i don't know how come you're doing it.
get your fucking hands off my daughter!
no. the real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. not my mind.
geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
she fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [beat] i came home from work and she was gone.
shit happens, and your life changes. 'bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [beat] so how come you don't know where you're coming from?
go fuck yourself.
no you won't.  you'll be back today. now!  you get your ass back here, thelma, now, goddamnit.  thelma, do you understand me?
no, thelma, i don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  i may not even make it home for dinner.  you know how fridays are.
there's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  and you blew it for 'em.  now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, i'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  i've got no feelin' for you.  but i may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance i can actually do them some good, or i'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  that's a sincere promise.
i'm sorry to bother you, i know you're real busy right now, but how many times, max?  how many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? you could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
oh shit.
naw, honey, that would be burglary. i never got arrested for burglary. burglary's for chicken shits.  if you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  just take the money.  that's robbery.  that's a whole 'nother deal.
i'm just some guy.  a guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
j.d.!  just tell me.  i know you're not some schoolboy.  now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
then what?!  what, goddamnit, louise!  where the fuck are you going?  are you just leaving for fucking ever?  what, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!

no, i'm out of town.  i'm in... i'm in real deep shit, jimmy.  deep shit arkansas.
shit!
shit!
does that mean suck my dick?
that guy was hurtin' me.  and if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  and probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  and they woulda made out like i asked for it.  and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  at least now i'm havin' fun.  and i'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. i'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  and if i haven't, i wanna take this time to thank you, louise.  thank you for savin' my ass.
shit.  i'm gettin' tired.
i don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  you just keep that shit away from me, now i mean it.
i know it's crazy, louise, but i just feel like i've got a knack for this shit.
i don't know!  shit!  let's just play it by ear.  he may not know. he may just give me a ticket.
suck my dick... boom!!
why not?!  what's he got to lose? other than my life's savings, that is.  shit!

okay.  shit, thelma!  what'd you do? i mean, what did you say?
oh shit, thelma!!  shit!  shit! shit!
don't you fall apart on me. goddamnit, thelma.  every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... not this time. everything's changed now... now you can do whatever you want, but i'm going to mexico.  i'm going.  are you coming with me?
thelma, i'm going to mexico.  i think i can make it in two and a half days, but i'm going to have to haul ass.  are you up to this?  i mean, i have to know.  this isn't a game.  i'm in deep shit.  i gotta know what you're gonna do.
shit!  i... i, which way?
well, i've had it up to my ass with sedate!  you said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!

--for the first time i'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- woodward, i got a tip. a guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named donald segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. the fbi knows about segretti-- howard hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. but segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the republicans knew what he was doing.
--shit, who do we know?--
--shit--

man, i don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
oh shit... no...
why the fuck would i do that?
i never thought i'd ask this of anyone, andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
oh shit! no! andy, don't let them take me back there!
andy, i have to tell you about the dream i had - or that i'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. but it is hyper-real. i'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... i'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. shit. i'm, uh, dead, aren't i?
shit. i feel sick.
aaaaa!!! get the fuck away from me!
yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
you fucking liar!
just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. i wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
you've got a lot of fucking gall.  thirty nine.
just don't fucking tell her.
you know sophia.  she's so damned judgemental.  and she's so damned... perfect.  and so fucking... serene.  just fucking don't tell her.  because you know mac thinks she's god.  and i can feel him comparing.
what a fucking day!  we only just got a sitter.  i don't know her from fucking adam.  she could be a serial killer.  i'm going to have to call every ten minutes. you have to let me give out the number.
fuck you.
you really need to be fucked.
shit, i forgot to call her back.  she's off on a trip somewhere.  oh god, my grandad's flat in london's been sold.
ow!  gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
it must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
fuck you.
hm.  do you like fucking out of doors?
damn near.  and a damn near perfect drug.
well it's fucking time.
ya vhol.  what are you, a fucking nazi?
what was it?  what the fuck was it?
life gets messy.  ugly messy.  but i don't understand you.  and i don't think i ever understood lucy.  i don't understand throwing it away.  how do you throw all that away?  any of it.  i want it all.  you guys want guarantees?  i want the possibilities.  and all kinds of crap comes with that.  a lot of bad shit. and i think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  all the good shit.  all the surprises.  it's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  we'd have had amazing children, you and me.  we'd have had a ride.  you'd have surprised yourself.  i'll never love anybody else, you know.
i found out i was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
it's a shit novel anyway.
who the fuck do you think you are?  the part of genna is not just about you. it's about every woman i've ever loved in my entire life.  including my mother. the character is also clearly in her early twenties, sally.
that hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  it's whether we can live together... like this!  all the time.
oh fuck you, and fuck monica while you're at it.  but i guess that's what i interrupted.
fuck you.
there are fucking coyotes out there.
she left the fucking gate open.

i'm not fucking angry, for god's sake.
and she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
no, no of course not.  how old is she? twenty-fucking-two?
no, no of course not.  it's skye fucking davidson, for fuck's sake.
stop being such a bitch, sal.
oh shit.  i'm sorry.  i'm a total fucking maniac.  delete all that, okay?  i spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  oh shit.  i get pissy sometimes. much worse than otis.  otis doesn't bite. it's just, i really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. we live in a canyon.  we hear dogs barking at night, too.  and it's not otis.
oh shit.  i'm sorry.
no, it's not... fuck fuck fuck fuck.

yeah, i did want to go on tv. that way i have a forum. i can fight back. i'm known. people see me. they know they can't fuck around with me like they could if i was an unknown. that's right.
your fuckin' ass! you could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  you wanted to go on tv.
you know i get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  they think you went batshit!
oh, i don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because i made that possible!
yeah, i said i - let the bullshit blow over for a while so i can run the casino. anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. it's not yours, it's my ass.
you want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
no? you said i'm bringin' heat on you?! i gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! you're ordering me out?! you better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? goin' over my head?
peekaboo, you fucks, you.
the coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and i mean every little fuckin' thing too.
fuckin' walking around with a big head. you better check yourself...
your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. that's your problem, pal.
the point is that she's upset. she's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
no, i didn't. what good would that do? that's not the fuckin' point.
well, she comes to see me. she was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' diamond - that lester diamond incident.
a fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
look at you. you're fuckin' walkin' around like john barrymore.
what the fuck happened to you? will you tell me?
well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. that looks bad.
yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. i plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  you know, i don't know what it is, sammy, but the more i talk to you, the more i feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
fuck the fbi! that prick's been dodging me for three weeks. and what is it with you?  all of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
i gotta do somethin'. i gotta do somethin'. they ain't gettin' rid of me. they're not gettin' rid of me. i'm staying here. fuck 'em. fuck 'em.
in other words, i'm fucked.
motherfucker.  unsavory fuckin'... is there any way around this?
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
but i'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. he knew all the fuckin' angles. he brought over the whole 'femme fatale' show from paris. but he forgot how lazy them european dancin' broads can get. i mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
it was so obvious. i mean, all of nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
to begin, i put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. you know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
when i married ginger i knew all the stories, but i didn't give a fuck. 'i'm sam rothstein,' i said. 'i can change her.'
me? that's why the bosses sent me out here. they wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [eddy and jerry]. they were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  yeah, right, i'm sure.
yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. it wasn't very scientific but it worked. when he won, he collected. when he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. what were they gonna do? muscle nicky?  nicky was the muscle.
i don't care. i want to get away from back home for a while. i'm tired of that shit back there.  look at this place. it's made of money. you know what the best part is? nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! there's nobody here to see us! everybody's back home.
holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
what's that? you hear? you hear a little girl, frankie? you hear a little girl, ace? is that a little fuckin' girl?!  what happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! huh?! huh?!
he bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
you know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
son-of-a-bitch. how the hell did you get oklahoma-michigan?  nobody ever had oklahoma-mi... how the hell'd you do it?
she's a fuckin' junkie. she's out of her fucking mind.  do you unders-
fuckin' asshole won't budge.
you ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! don't fuckin' ignore me! you motherfucker!
oh, fuck you! fuck you, sam rothstein!  fuck you!
you make me sick, you fuck. once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
so what? so who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
and what? and let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? and let you disgrace me?  get up. get up and be a mother. get in the car and go to the house...
you listen carefully! you ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, i'll fuckin' kill you.  pure and simple. do you hear me? pure and fuckin' simple, i'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
fuck you.
listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  listen, you fuckin' cunt.
i ought to fuckin' have you committed. you fuckin' do that again,  i'll f-, i'll f-
...you out of your mind? that's our child. are you out of your fuckin' mind?
i mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  are...
stop! you aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
here. here. is this enough money?! huh?  will it last you two fuckin' days? take it, greedy bitch.  take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
fuck you!
i'll get your cash. you haven't been straight with me ever since i met you! you never loved me in the first place!  i need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
i under-understand that. i-i know i fucked up.
yeah, and i get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
you know what, ace? i don't give a shit! i'm gettin' out of here.  i am.
didn't. no, instead, what did he say? 'fuck him. take him for everything he's got.'
we're not getting any younger. don't you think it's time? aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? bangin' around, hustlin' around?
yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. you son-of-a-bitch. you son-of- a
listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. if you did know, you were in on it. either way, you're out!  get out! go on.  let's go.
listen, you fuckin' yokel, i've had it with you. i've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since i got here. get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
hey... ward, you're pissin' me off. now, you're insulting my intelligence. what do you think, i'm a fuckin' idiot? you know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? why didn't you pull the machines? why didn't you call me?
well, thank you. why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
you're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. you see that fuckin' saw?  we're gonna use it. you don't fuck around in this place. you got it?
fuckin' kids at home!  here.  get the fuck out of here.
don't fuck with me, al! don't make a fuck out of me! you want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  you didn't gamble?! tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, i'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! did you gamble?! huh?!
you call yourself a man? you know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? you know that's what you are? two small kids at home. i gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. you know your wife called frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
we're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
well, i keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. i mean, what hell's goin' on? what are we doin' over here?
never mind fuckin' sam. this is personal.  i'll be there in the morning. you can fuckin' try me, fatso.
hey, you fat irish prick. you put my fuckin' money to sleep. you go get my money, or i'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
go back inside! this is none of your business!  i don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
...fuckin' jerk-off.
you - you fuckin' moron, i'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
it looked like a fuckin' gun!
you know who you're fuckin' with?! huh? do you?!
fuck you! fuck you!
you took your boots off? you put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  you fuck me up over there, i'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! you understand?  go over there and apologize.  go! get the fuck out of -
tell him to go fuck himself? you fuckin' hick!  fuckin'...
turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
why, does it look like it's bothering me? what do i give a fuck?  fuckin' oscar too. all the fuckin' money i've given that prick, he don't even look over here. what's his problem?
yeah. fuck him.
i'm positive.  remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
because there's one thing about these old timers: they don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. it's bad for business.
not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  okay?
but back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. to them, he was a cash register. all they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. especially remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
you fucked with me for the last time!
i don't need you! i have my own fuckin' money!
get the fuck out of here.
get the fuck out of here. get out! get the fuck out!
ah, you fuck! you're such a fuckin' asshole!
how the fuck am i gonna get your fuckin' money now? you think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? are you out of your mind?!  look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! if you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  ah, what the fuck is the use? i should've never got invol-
hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  i mean, i know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, i'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  fuck... motherfucker! i knew this, i knew it.
i told you this was fuckin' dangerous. remember i said, 'ginger, this is a dangerous situation. be very careful.' you fuckin' yessed me to death.
what did i tell you? supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  i gotta know exactly what you said. tell me what you said to him.
mm... okay. don't worry about it. nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. i'll take care of ya.
i'm not and he scares the shit out of me. i never know what he's gonna do.
he hates my fuckin' guts.
he really thinks who the fuck he is, i'll tell you that.
yeah.  boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
he holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
and take it easy with this shit, will you? i mean, this can only make matters worse.
he gives a fuck what i do?
he didn't have to hit him. it's not exactly like i'm sleepin' with the guy! and he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! what the fuck is that all about?
no! no! i told him all about the guy before we ever got married. this is no fuckin' surprise.
yeah, no shit.
so, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
that bag's full of fuckin' chips you
don't give me that shit. i want my money.
what money?  look at this stack of chips. don't give me that shit. i want my end.
oh, what bullshit? what, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
it's this bullshit. it's just bullshit right here. this is the fuckin' problem, you know.
what do you think we're gonna do? he's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
don't give me any of your shit!  okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
we're going to europe. let the adults talk.  you dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. right? you're the mother. how much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
no more fuckin' dirty work!
fuck you, you motherfuck!
frankie! frankie, you piece of shit!
i'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. you know that? bad fuckin' spot.
i fucked up, frankie. i fucked up good this time. should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
get her the fuck out of here. get her out of here.
why'd i get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? get out!
yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. i don't know. they're all over the joint.
i told him i didn't know nothin'. but jiggs and, uh, tony gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
go fuck yourself.
they want a fuckin' war, i'm ready.
i do all the work. somebody don't like it, fuck him.
i mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. i mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
what, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
sometimes i used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. but i didn't like the people i was rippin' off lookin' at me, so i used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. come here. come here. get him up. come here.
'cause you're a jag-off. i would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
charlie m? you make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? charlie m? you dumb motherfucker!
oh, god! give me the fuckin' name!
this motherfucker, do you believe this? two fuckin' days and nights!  fuck me?
fuck you!
your fuckin' head, huh? don't fuck around, tony.
my fuckin' head.
yeah, i know, that's why you had it ready. you thought i was fuckin' layin' it?!
maybe if i stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. give me the fuckin' money!
...behind my head. they trust that scumbag, i don't. right now, the way i feel, i'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
he ran out on me to be with you? well fuck him!  everything worked twice as good without him.  we didn't need him then and i don't need him now.
i am not!  fuck you!  theo's a genius.
this is my conversation.  i'll say what i fucking please.
me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
no reason to kill innocent bystanders.  shit.  i can't hardly move my neck.
you almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  you stupid fuck!
so theo and nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  a thing of beauty. jesus, the shit you come up with!
it took you long enough to get my ass out.
shit.  there's the hotel.  you overshot the driveway.
just like they say no fucking self control.
just hand up on the bitch!  fuck you, madam.  and goodbye!
we've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
don't fuck around.  pop a cap in him.
it's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
he let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
that's where this chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  i could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. she showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
a typical fuck-up.
shit.  you couldn't be in much worse shape.
there was <u>no</u> cop involved.  oh shit!  fuck!
i got what i fucking deserved.  i had it all.  i could've kept going!
shit.  i'm sorry.
shit, stop with the money!  i never asked for a nickel.  i was just doing this.  and you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
it never healed.  i called her a lying bitch and everything else and i hung up on her.  "click." you don't exist.
where's the fucking recharger cord?  must be in her car, dammit.
shit!
fucking "a" it is!  any argument and i'm out of here.
there's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
you got time on your side.  pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
that bitch.  what's keeping you from taking off?
and i end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
the fuck i will!
okay nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  i'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
who the fuck you kidding?  send me money!
she wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
fucking men, col --
yeah. fuck it, dil.
fuck it, is what i say.
no. tell him to go fuck himself.
no, i won't fucking fuck off. said i'm sorry, didn't i?
fuck off, dave.
take your fucking goldfish, too!
fucking mad!
fuck off back to essex!
hey, stirling fucking moss --
cunt.
cunt. scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
cunt.
who the fuck is he?
you fucking did.
fuck off, dave.
jim, pat, mick, what the fuck. long as you remember you're not at lords.
and she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
let me go for fuck's sake, dil -- or they'll be here
dil! dil! what the fuck are you doing here?
jesus fucking christ.
so i suppose a fuck is out of the question. keep your head down, fergus. no sudden moves. and not a whisper to her. you'll be hearing from us.
so you did fuck up.
what was it, fergus? did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
fucking do. i had him all over me.
and you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
fuck you, too --
what the fuck is this?
come on, man. if this shit was all over.
well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
so when you come to shoot me, paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
what the fuck were you doing here?
what the fuck am i doing here.
okay. that nice lady. meets me in a bar. i'm saying what the fuck am i doing here anyway. she buys me a drink. she holds my hand. i'm looking at her saying i don't like you, bitch. but what the fuck. maybe i'll get to understand.
you fuckers set me up. that bitch --
so what were you fucking around for, then?
what the fuck do you know about my people?
no fucking way.
i seen your fucking face.
fuck you.
i said shut the fuck up --
thought you liked me, bitch.
who gives a fuck.
no, fuck the bear. the name. jude. and it's june. jude in june.
give me the fucking shooter!
shut the fuck up, jude.
i'm not fucking you. not for all your cds.
as fucking if.
i never fucked rod.
i wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
i don't give a fuck what your reasons are. you pay me ten dollars, you can go inside otherwise, get a warrant.
i knew you were a pervert. always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
i was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
you fucked me up!
that was before he pulled this 'dick me or i dump you' shit. i say fuck his best friend.
maybe i should blister through a bottle of tequila and just fuck his brains out.
i doubt it. who'd want to fuck her. she probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
does she fuck?
you are 'sp fucking' wrong.
you're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
he's dead! we've got to get the fuck out of here!
you break up with me because i won't fuck you.
let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
i can't believe i listened to one word of his shit.
fuck your curfew. most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
shit!
oh, shit.
...shit.
at least somebody likes this shit.
we're the shit.  bigtime.
...our ass!
oh, shit.
oh, fuck!
aw, shit.  would you be more care-...
we're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
...shit.
...shit.
well, shit.  could be worse.  i mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  my credit was fucked!  and then when he promoted sam over me, i just snapped.  so i split.
i deserve a lot more than that truck! ten years, ten years i busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
...piece of shit was worth.
you're fucked, man.
oh, shit!
oh, shit.
oh, shit.  okay.  come on.

don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! they still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
oh, shit.
i'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
look, i don't give a shit if you go through missoula at a hundred miles an hour.  we're goin' to mcgruder.
it happens to this piece of shit...
yeah, to keep him off my ass.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, i'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible.
and if that elvis shit...
look...i got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  that shit will be worthless by noon.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
the guy's a fuckin' moron.
sam?  andy gave sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
why don't you get that tub of shit sam to...
shit.
elvis is fuckin' dead, man.  get yourself some cds.
we gotta get help.  aw, fuck!  damn.
missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  i told you mason was walking shit.
shit!  oh, shit.
then how about if i call you "ass-...
you bet your ass you don't. you can't even pay me off.
sue the shit out of 'em.
yeah, i once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. that's where she drew the line.
when i find out who that phony bitch was.
alfredo, go fuck yourself!!!
what the fuck you talking about? you getting into the act too, toto? titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and i have to say thanks! if i ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
you think i'm shitting you...
dick.
i didn't just fuck myself! jesus, i'm going to be sick!
this isn't fucking funny, dante!
this is the last time i ever come here.  and if i ever see you again, i'm gonna break your fucking head open!
"space alien revealed as head of time warner reports stock increase."  they print any kind of shit in these papers.
give me a stick, pretty boy! i'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
i can whip your ass.
fuck in a second! this is... look at you! you can't even pass!
what the fuck is this?! i want some service!
fuck that! i'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
shit!
get the fuck outta here already.
no thanks. i'll take care of it. we've got a lot of shit to talk about.
why the fuck did you tell veronica that i was going to dump her for caitlin?
point is-i'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
my mother told me once that when i as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, i chose to shit my pants.
what? the dead guy?  she'll get over fucking the dead guy. shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years i call him dad.
i'm satisfied with my situation for now. you don't hear me bitching. you, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
fuck you.
yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
i should shit or get off the pot.
you should shit or get off the pot.
shut the fuck up!
you just fucked a total stranger?
fuck you.
all right, but you're missing out. chicks with dicks.
holy shit. that girl?
what the fuck did you do that for?
her fucking body fell out!
you knocked the fucking casket over, for chrissakes!
i can't fucking believe you!!
what, your dick?
his dick was in his mouth?
my cousin? my aunt found him. on his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. dick in his mouth. my aunt freaked out. it was a mess.
because i never tried to suck my own dick?
come on. haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
shit. what about tomorrow?
bitch, bitch, bitch. you want something to drink?
would you shut the hell up with that shit? it's not helping.
fuck!
not a fucking word! slippery shit!
who cares? that lady's an asshole. everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. this job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  these chicks do it all. they insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  he's led a very sheltered life.
oh shit, i've got to place an order.
that's not cheating. people say crazy shit during sex. one time, i called this girl "mom."
shit, if i'd known you were working, i would've come even later.
what? when? when did all this shit happen?
i don't know. she was senile and shit. used to piss herself all the time. c'mon silent bob.
i've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  shit, my grandma used to say, "which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." no, wait. i fucked up. she said "what's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
i don't know dude. that caitlin chick's nice. but i see that veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. she brings you food, she rubs your back... didn't i see her change your tire one day?
probably saw that caitlin chick. i know i felt like beatin' it when i saw her.  come here, bitch! you like this? is this what you want? hunhh?
that's fucked up. yo, i heard he was jerkin' off.
relax brother. what i mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. a dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
listen to you. oh shit. "oh, i don't hang out with drug dealers."
wanna come to this party tonight? there's gonna be some pussy there, man!
such a wiseass. but go ahead. crack wise. that's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  i got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  you make sure this gets back. the number's eight-twelve-wynarski. and i wanted to get a damn movie, too.
it's not like it's a demanding job. i'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch tv. the other day i walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
fuck you.
you're damn right it's not like that! because i won't let it be like that! you want your slut? fine!  the slut is yours!
and then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because i've gone down on a couple guys!
what the fuck did you do that for?
well... why did you have to suck their dicks? why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
no, but you sucked enough dick!
hey listen, jerk! until today you never even knew how many guys i'd slept with, because you never even asked. and then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. well, i never had sex with twelve different guys!

you sucked his dick!

you think i wanted to come here tonight?  you think i'm that stupid? sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
you tell me.  i had to toss the list in the river.  i was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  so why don't you show a little courtesy?
i think...  ...i think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
oh, we working for the feds now?  if my snitch flew out a window, he's got dmitri's handprints on his ass. that makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
dmitri <u>gusunov?</u> what the fuck, why? forget about dimitri, feds are all over him.  they're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
i'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
i give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
<u>so?</u> aside from i hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
<u>i'm</u> full of shit?  you're a monument of bullshit.  you even bullshitted yourself all i am, is taking out the garbage.  bad guys killing bad guys...
you're full of shit.
he hated everything i did.  hated me. got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...

i'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
next time you pull any shit, i'm gonna kick your fat ass.
tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
i can't do that.  he's the man.  he'll fire my ass.

it's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  you've got to listen to me.
sometimes i wisht people was like dogs, luke. comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. she just don't give a damn. they let you smoke?
well, you got yourself some time now. two years. hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. we got one who's got all of it. we got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. you'll learn the rules. it's all up to you. i can be a good guy or i can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.

you can't go out lecturing?  tough shit.  women are dying.  where can i lay this stuff out?
well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  i'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but i get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  i guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
who gives a fuck?  in all the years i never seen you cry.  you loved him.
yeah, you did that too.  you earned what you got don't shit on it, that's all i'm saying.
you're shitting ion your career.  you outrank hi...
what am i wasting my time with this shit for?
the woman was in shock.  she was totally out on ranks.  i stayed because i didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  stop that, you son of a bitch!  the place wasn't secure.  i was doing my goddamn job!  and, for the <u>second time</u>, i slept in her living room.
snotty neurotic bitch...
give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
what does this mean?  now we got the fbi, my team is expendable? i'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  why ruben, anyway?  he and nikko don't even get on together...
we're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the grateful dead!  sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
i tagged the goddamned stocking. it ain't lost.  we're sequestering that evidence.  that's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...

i'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the states and live the good life.
you're fucked, sami. you know it.   that's why you're here.
this is turning to shit. if word gets out of my involvement in this i'll go to prison.
i'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that i believe you and right now i don't. so tell me, where did they go?
then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? everybody knows what better than expected means.
bastaldi's dead. he is fuckin' dead!
he said to go fuck yourself.
what is that a threat? are you fuckin' threatening me, marcel?
fuck you! you know i'd never go along with something like this.
you know, if you could get your nose out of bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
all you are is a professional ass-kisser.
i think he'd cut his dick off if bastaldi told him to.
i would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. you gave us the wrong address sophie.
i ain't bullshittin'. i can get guns. i can get any kind of gun you want. but they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. you ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in chicago looking for you. how is that possible?
i don't give a shit about your cousin's car. we're here about my car. so, shut your mouth! you think you can do that? you think you can keep your big mouth shut?
great fuckin' song.
this is bad. this is really fuckin' bad. am i the only one who sees how bad this is?
how about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
pink panther, black panther. who gives a shit? and i don't remember asking you a god damn thing, you little turd.

fuck me?   fuck you!
fuck you, grease-ball!
and i'm tellin' you it ain't! now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
no shit?
i said knock it off! now as far as i'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
holy shit.
i've been thinking about getting tattoo. you know, a flower or something. on my ass.
for me? what am i going to do with a piece of shit like this?
this sack of shit is called tin- tin.
don't thank me.  your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
fucking a, my friend.
listen:  top dollar.  he "owns the street here."  he will "erase my ass."
oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  i nearly had a fucking heart attack.
holy shit... you're dead, man...
hey, i got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
last halloween, eh?  yeah...  yeah, i remember.  i fucked her too, i think.
little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  this dick trying to bushwack me.
i never forget anything, dickhead. that building was a sweep-and- clear the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  it got a little rowdy... end of story.
like the car.  he hangs out with skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the pit -- hell, funboy lives there.  ask top dollar.
i ain't got no fuckin' ring.
does it hurt?!  you dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  what the shit are you gonna do about this?!
very well, it's your ass.
oh cut the shit, kathryn.
i know. i wish i felt the same. unfortunately, i feel nothing. i think it was just the conquest. sorry, i'm completely fucked up.
it's not you, it's me. i'm completely fucked up.
oh please annette. you spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. well here it is. right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. i'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. if we were, i'd propose, but that's not going to happen. so i guess we're just fucked. i'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. and that makes you a hypocrite.
give me the fucking letter.
look, i've got a lot of problems and i'm trying to deal with them and the last thing i need is people spreading shit about me.
who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
i was just being honest. you happen to have a nice ass. sorry.
are you shitting me?
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
it is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
grand central. you better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
mcconnell, i'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
hey blaine, did i leave my... holy shit.
he doesn't scare me. i'll kick his ass in.
i'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
i knew this guy last summer in the hamptons. he and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. but she had this huge weight problem. his friends taunted him mercilessly about it. you know, "how do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "it's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. she flipped and he went on the defensive. i distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "i'm completely fucked up." "i'm completely fucked up." "i'm completely fucked up."  poor fatty never had a chance.
i want to fuck.
you're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. god are you a chump.
eat me, sebastian. it's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because i'm a girl it's wrong. well let me tell you something, i didn't ask to be a girl. do you think i relish the fact that i have to act like mary sunshine twenty four seven, so i can be considered a "laaaady." do you think i take great delight when i hear - "kathryn is so wonderful." "kathryn is a model child." "kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  i'm the marsha fucking brady of the upper east side and sometimes i want to kill myself for it. no, i don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. so there's your psychoanalysis doctor freud. now are you in or are you out?
are you really? i mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... i mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. you do realize that.
fuck her yet?
in english.  i'll fuck your brains out.
she's quite cute you know. young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
yep. then i fucked your daughter.
don't know what i'm talking about? i know that you fucked cecile.
yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, i have abundant sperm syndrome.
you scared the shit out of me. i thought you were killing yourself.
the thing is, i really like him. i finally meet a guy i really like and i'm a fuckin' werewolf.
what the fuck are we going to do?
fuck it's the cops. peter saw me, now i have to let him in.
why the fuck would you do that?
holy shit, i don't know.
shit, i guess i missed work.
you fucked carlton? see i told you he liked you.
i look like fuckin' chewbacca.
oh my god. i've never had that before. i've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "hey there beautiful."
no, did you fuck him?
holy shit, i'm a freak.
what a bitch. you should see a doctor. that can be dangerous. george bit me once and i had to go to the emergency room.
can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
come on frida, i'm not kidding. i'm totally fucked. let me in.
shit. and you're eating my burger? you don't eat meat.
oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. you following me again?
you use the word "fucking." you're sexualizing things. stop berating yourself. it's okay to have sex.
cause i'm a fucking werewolf!!
oh great. what the fuck am i supposed to do?
i'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat i'm allergic to cause your friend's got pms?
what the fuck are you following me for? i'm not a suspect here.
it has to be frida. this makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
like a vampire or some shit?
hell no, i'm not into that shit. the sight of blood makes me sick.
hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? said some chick bit her at victoria's secret. bitches are outta control these days.
yeah, im like that.  senility says the wife.  but she sure cant complain.  heh.  the erector set still works good.  and this aint no fucking rug! ghead.  feel it!  all mine!

stop busting my balls.  i said i'm listening ten fucking times already.
fuck you and stay off the phone.
i ain't getting shit.
i don't think so. this guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
damn right i did it. went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and i ended up doing ten years at rikers, got my teeth knocked out by mike the dyke.
shit!  bela, what's with the gun?
fuck you!  <u>you</u> come out here.  hey, toss me that j.d.
"dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  a lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  damn!  eddie, i'm sorry i can't remember all this.  i'm an old man. it's too long.
we can't.  those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
back in the old days, yes.  but now -- no one give two fucks for bela.
oh, there's my bus.  shit, where's my transfer?!
that's tony mccoy.  he's playing lieutenant dick craig.
you're a fuckin' mess.
toss us out on our ass.
what, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  what kind of sick mind would operate like that?
hey big shot, get off your ass.  they need a potted palm over in the carl laemmle building.
screw you, wood!  i even sunk more money into different titles: "transvestite" "he or she?" "i led two lives"... it doesn't matter! nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
i did.  i established some tits and ass.
fuck no!  but there's a poster.
yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  it ain't gonna be the christine jorgensen story no more. goddamn "variety" printed the story before i had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
i was a fuckin' hack!  i let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  i let bela down...
does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
well, now i will. he was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
she doesn't give a shit about him.
no. you screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. you never gave a shit about me.
yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. they weren't bozos! i'm pumpkin ass again!
and all the kids stared calling me "pumpkin ass." "hey pumpkin ass," -- for like a year. so, now, i feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, i'm "pumpkin ass" again.
ed, come on. what's that gonna do? you're gonna bring blockbuster to their knees. let me recommend a movie to you. it's called "get your shit together before it's too late."
this is going right up your ass.
don't defend that horse's ass to me.
dick.
dick... dick,..
larry, we're not electing the fucking pope here. just tell me who won.
fuck me, mr. mcallister
that little bitch made a fool of us i want her out of the election. getting everybody all riled up like that.  she's finished, you hear me? washed up.

no.  now.  you fucked him.
you fuck for money.
you say 'fuck' a lot.
maybe i'm just fucking curious.
miss bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or i'll have you and patchett in shit up to your ears.
have you ever heard of dick stensland?
doing what?  mowing your fucking lawn?
there are no rules!  why the fuck are you doing this?  the nite owl made you.  you want to tear all that down.
get the fuck away from me.
that's why her mother couldn't i.d. her... jesus fucking christ.
dick stensland.  had to be dumb panic.  if she knew him she would've been sitting with him... right?
ty and larry fuck with that shit, not me.
that fucking larry.  i almost believed him.
in my car.  blackmail shit.  the trunk under the carpet.  patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt lynn, looks just like veronicaaa --
it's a private investigation.  i fucked something up and i want to make amends.
<u>shit</u>.  someone beat us here.
i see bud because he makes me feel like lynn bracken and not some veronica lake look-alike who fucks for money.  i see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  there's more if you want to hear it.
he can take care of himself and i'm not afraid of you.  and you forgot one thing, lieutenant. pierce also taught me how to fuck... can i get you a drink?
contract players at metro.  you pinch 'em.  i do you up feature in the next issue.  plus the usual fifty cash.  tell me, am i fucking santa claus?
goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on cnn!
well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, david, maybe i'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
shit.
what if we just fucked with 'em?
drive or i'll blow your fuckin' head off.
what the fuck?!
you don't get it. they go through your phone records. they fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
no shit.
you don't know who the fuck--
is this a fuckin' joke?
fuck you. when you needed information, i got it. you didn't care how.
shut the fuck up.
fuck off.
go fuck yourself.
dick burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
i said fuck you.
fuck you.
the fuck do you have goin' on with sam albert?
no!  no!  don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
that's your name innit?  count fucking arsehole von bismarck? what's that supposed to be then, irish?
listen, fritz, if i have to listen to another word from you i'll give you a fucking good hiding.
i'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  it's like he slammed a door in cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in tobruk.
don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
is it you?  if i said moose i look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
fucking thing!!!
let me ask you, this mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
you're not the one trying to get all this shit. you think they've just got a crooks r us on every corner?
what the fuck did you do with my stuff?
that asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
the luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, erin.  the luckiest son of a bitch in history.
say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on earth if i didn't up and quit over all this.
ho - ly - shit.
fuck kurt.
the fuck i'm not.  i don't care what the doctor says --
i'm not gonna fire you.  i wanted to.  but then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  you embarrassed me, erin.
if you tell me to relax, i'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
why the fuck should i respect her?
holy shit.  who do they represent, god?
whoa.  no shit.
you might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  my kids are sitting in the god damn parking lot right now, cause i still don't make enough to afford good child care. makes me think about looking around for a job where i'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
fuck you.  make time.  cause i bust my ass for you.  i watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  and what do you do for me?  huh?  you see the way i'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work i'm doing?  have you ever bothered saying, hey, erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits she gets paid the most cause she's the best god damn employee i've ever had?
it's my paycheck.  which i earned.  which i deserve.  which i shouldn't have to beg for. that fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
yeah, i mind.  you bet your ass i mind.
i want my fucking money --
jesus christ, ed -- you know, the more i work on this thing, the more i realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  that's just not right.
no shit.
see, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  but guess what --
they covered 'em over.  and not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
okay, fine.  i don't know shit about shit. but i know the difference --
we can get these people.  with a little effort, i really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
and this shit is bad news, mr. masry.  not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your dna, too.  that means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
that wasn't an offer.  a million would've been an offer.  when they send the god damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
yeah?  well, fuck you.  sorry doesn't feed my kids.
hey, ross.  tell me something.  does pg&e pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
i know.  but still.  six months.  i think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but i'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
bull<u>shit</u>, erin.  bullshit.
fuck you.  just cause i don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit i am --
no, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant pg&e fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  but you know what?  they're wrong.
shit, yeah.  i got numbers coming out of my ears.  like, for instance, ten.
i am not talking to you, bitch.
shit.
my name is no longer carjack. will you please get that through your fucking head?
maybe. but you're not putting any shit in me this time.
and i don't need to know. so fuck you, i'm goin' to hollywood.
why don't you get out of l.a.? take a boat to china, take an airplane to brazil?  earthquakes, death, shit. why do you stay?
no screamin' shit.
fuck it.
oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
oh. what are you talking about for christ sake! did you see her or not? she's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
well, specifically, mrs. macneil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
not a psychiatrist! she needs a priest! she's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! jesus christ, won't somebody help her!

are you kidding me?  are you fucking kidding me?
no, that's your problem, frank.  you get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
you're a fucking alarm clock.
frank.  fuck it.  okay?

they don't give two fucks about your health.  the clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  look at o'neill --
like i had a choice with that anal-retentive jon archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  at least he took an interest. you took off without leaving so much as a post-it.
"thanks?"  i guess they really did fuck you up.
retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  you gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
do you know what it is to be in a coma?  it fucks up everything -- including your memory! i can't even tell you why dobbs jumped me yesterday!
i was in a coma, pollux. i still feel like shit.
you're not my brother.  the brother i knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck archer.  at least tell me the bomb is still going off.
what the fuck do you think happened?  castor troy just shot him!  what are you waiting for?  go!
like i fucking care?  i'm not just sitting here!
yeah -- it's santa's magic fucking village.  your present's in here.
don't worry, nobody knows i'm inside.  check it out.  remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in thailand?  he's being treated for bone cancer at the v.a.  thanks to the miracle of nsa grid-technology ...  -- ooops!  his radiation does just quadrupled.
you better get used to it. that bitch lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?

well, a course they're gonna say that! but where's my protection? they got jean here! i give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
six months ago, bob's testicles were removed.  then hormone therapy.  he developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  that was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of god's as big.
just who the fuck do you think you are?!  get out!  you're fired!

she needs an exorcist.  this isn't love.  this is sport-fucking.
she is a wild, twisted bitch.  stay away from that one.
a guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  after a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
this fight, pussy.
shit.  sorry.  that didn't count.
why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
i mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  the trendy paper lamps, the euro-trash shelving unit, am i right?
why?  so you can say, "oh, that's what you do." -- and be a smug little shit about it?
alright, christ!  fucking let me go!
okay!  okay, fuck it!  use the basement!  get off me!
yeah, fuck 'em.  no offense.
holy shit.  he said "only new life can defeat death."  if she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of death's design...
a trans am.  that shit went out with new kids on the block.

jorge.  when i get out of here i'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
but why single me out?  what am i in the great scheme of things?  you'd think i stepped off flight 180 or something... fucking weird, man.
here's what i don't get.  for nine months, death does all this shit to make sure i win these tickets and end up on route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
yeah, i hate to love and leave ya, but i've been over this x-files shit since the sixth season.

i get this feeling like i'm... a magnet but i attract shit.  out of all the people in this city, why did i meet a man who's wife i killed?
people spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  it's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
you're out of your fucking mind!!
come on, try it. ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. come on!

no, not for sure. when it comes, it comes. you gonna want some shit?
gee, i must have been shit-faced at your wedding, i don't --
but not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
why not? oh shit... really?
what cheap shit... hey, waiter!
i've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
after their initial investment in the factory, grendel didn't need them.  told them to fuck off. they tried to get these c.d.s together in order to have proof of grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  now's the fun part...
i believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  what were your words...  'a fucking c.d.  this case is closed.'
a fucking c.d.  wow, this case is closed.  so, she's got bad taste in music and in men... did i tell you she and johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
you're a fucking gentleman.  what do you want from me?
this is fucking unbelievable.  zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
suck a dick, i left my purse...
hey, i love you, too, you little jerk.  jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
fuck that, i mean, the heck with that.  i kicked their ass!  well, i tried.  there were two of them you know...
these two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  i think armani.  they were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... i did what you would have done.
why am i what?  excuse me?  i catch you saying the f-word again.  i'll kill you.  that's a fucking promise.  now get the fuck out of here.
when you going to let me work with you?  why you always fucking with me?

i was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
why shucks, lt. anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...

you gotta be kidding!  this is unfuckingbelievable!  i have to start the evening crawling down capital records, i shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  next up, my guitar! the second most important thing i own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on hollywood boulevard!  then, then, after i burned up your brother, jazz... i should say as a fucking footnote i've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out domino's pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... tonight was different. i felt respect.  i felt love.  then jazz left me... and <u>now</u> i get to die!
fuck me...
shit.
yeah, yeah, i know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  shit, just start torturing me, man.  i didn't even know johnny had a disc and i can't deal with any 'don't play games with me, mr. fairlane' bullshit.
and if i told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
yeah, i did, you condescending fuck, but i miss snoopy coming out at the end.  isn't your enjoyment impaired?
i'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
it's my daughter, man.  i know i never told you about her, but god, i love that girl.  she calls herself zuzu petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is l.a. a fucking groupie partying with the pros.  you have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
fucking amazing, huh?  chevy nova, you bensonhurst shit!  still in la-la land.  look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
you don't use shit?
you made three sales to your roaches back there.  we had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
fuck you, santa claus!
il est en retard.

this is a real piece of shit.
you people baffle me. you spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
"a history of the united states, volume i." if you want to read a real history book, read howard zinn's "a people's history of the united states." that book will knock you on your ass.

in fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? you could say that in the scale of these things this is the mount fucking everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . and the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?

no.  at the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. he showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  jelly. shit...
i can do a lot of shit, d'amour. but you know that.  so i like playing games with people.  gives them something to wonder about...
you know, it's such a fucking waste.  you can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
why?  so you can fuck my wife?

but that was a dumb-ass pass to toni. ten seconds left, you run out the clock.

just some guy. does it even matter who? i stopped asking myself why a long time ago. no reason, no conspiracy just bad fucking luck. a couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. when you killed him,			* i've never seen you so happy - i was convinced you'd remember. but it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. like this won't stick.
i'm not. i was the cop assigned to your			* wife's death. i believed you, i thought			* you deserved the chance for revenge. i helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. the guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.		    * we found him and you killed him.				  *   memento - green revisions 10-4-99 115a.

stop shitting me, man!
the prison, man. there was this german cat an architect in the hospital. he was helping the turks build some shit round the place. i laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.

look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. i'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. no one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
...one night i was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. i thought, 'oh shit, somebody's broken in.' i didn't own a gun, so i go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. okay, it turned out to be nothing. god made the noise. who knows?

rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. no one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. you never dreamed about being popular- you already were. all i wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. i can't do all that again. i can't go back to southglen south.
don't be a smart ass.
he's dead, you bitch.
i'm not afraid of you.  you couldn't kill me...he's in there and i want him back.  i'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!

'cause that's the way guys are -- they laugh when ya talk dirty. they think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. ya get no respect... i gotta use a bad word -- whore. you'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
ya want the truth -- ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- the only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.

check this out.  gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  when he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some eastern bloc country where nobody had shit and gregor had everything.  then the wall goes down.  no more cold war.  and gregor is out of a job.  no apartment, no special stores with western food and video tapes.  i would bet dollars against shit that gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  and i wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
the two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
good, because it cost enough.  there's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
what are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
fine with fucking me, we got work to do. i don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  i don't know about the rest of you guys, but i'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  i don't mean that in, like, a literal way...

i don't know!  shit, give me a break!
i don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  besides, i'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
i could kill that no good son of a bitch!

don't be giving me attitude, lee.  i've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  we haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  i'm on vacation, and i want some mu-shu.
i warned you about playing that shit when i'm in the car.
don't push it. you better watch your ass with these fed types. if there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve johnson's ass.  well...you know what i mean.
he'll be ok. russ is a tough son of a bitch.
i'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  your ass is goin' to jail!
fbi calls up my ass, says they need help in tokyo.  like i'm supposed to drop everything.
it ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  take the damn gun.
no, like a tourist.  you know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
yeah, somethin' like that.  ok, now this is a nasty ass place. when you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. you got to maintain control. you following me? you lose it, you get hurt. now, you're my responsibility and i don't want you hurt. you understand?  ok, let's go.
bullshit!  you were trying' to lose my ass again.
it was my ass that almost got trashed!
that silly-ass look on your face.
look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. okay?  we're gonna be in some deep shit here.  working the danger zone. and you need insurance.  cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
we are both full of shit.
okay, fine, you're full a shit, i'm full a shit.
not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  you seemed as if you liked to talk.  i like to let people talk who like to talk.  it makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
you're full of shit.  do you understand what i'm saying to you? full of shit?
yeah, well you're in american now. everybody's got guns.  that tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. you do it again, nobody, not rhonda, not yolanda, gonna save your ass.
okay, i'll slow down.  so we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  how old are you?  you ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
look at me! my dress is ruined. i look like shit.
okay, let me start from the top.  a few days ago i was on this munitions dealer named lafontaine. now, after the shit blew up last night...
just make him think you're following leads.  interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  i don't care.  i just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  his plane lands in an hour. don't be late.
you got a boy friend in here yet? cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
shit, i ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  that does nothin' for me.  no. i don't need to be pattin' no ass. all i'm sayin' is, how do i know you're not a cop?
i oughta pat your ass down.  make sure you're not a cop.
fuck man. come on, bobby.
ass first into the world.
who the fuck are you? dr. joyce brothers?
nah. i'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
fuck you.
who the fuck are you, dr. joyce brothers?  i hate the son-of-a-bitch.
can you do me a favor? this girl i know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. i promised her i'd try to help.
oh shit
hey, you did the right thing. you wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. they have eaten your ass alive.
you. you're smooth. you use words like dire and shit.  you got language skills, man.
was.  i'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  you got anything for me?
what the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
can i pull my fucking dick out?!
i didn't fucking do anything! i swear to god!
no shit?  fuck it.  i'll send it to oliver stone then. he'll get them to reopen the bastard.
answer the fucking question!
news-flash, tanner. i'm a fucking rat.
no. you just handed us a new one.  we can go federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  what's the mandatory on that, al?
after that ass-whipping you gave me?
you better not be blowing smoke up my ass, flynne.
i can't help it, tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
cut the shit, flynne.
bobby laid his own tracks.  he could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. and as far as i'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  now take the money.
garcetti thinks everything is shit. he doesn't even like dolphins.
garcetti thinks i'm a pile of shit.
you know, i'm starting to think i'd rather take my chances with domingo than go through any more of this shit.
anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
fuck you, garcetti. i been at this for almost a year. i've done everything you guys have asked of me.
cut to the fucking chase, flynne.
tom, quit fucking around.
and he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
shit, that was no big deal.
fuck private james ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
if we find ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned b.a.r. back to the beach for me.
simpson?  jesus christ on a fucking pogo stick!
you're goddamned right, i give the order.  vote!  jesus christ!  listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes, is that clear?
i have no fucking idea.  here we come.  cover me.
well now i'm saying we're moving out.  get off your ass.
out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
shit, sir.
shit, that's nothing, i ran twenty- two flat.
hello constance.  it's me, lloyd... nothing, i'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do i do?  can't she come back?  how can i get her back?... i can't think, talk to me... i fucked up... i feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  i gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
oh shit.
you shared it with a dick.
i feel like a dick.  you must think i'm a dick.
shit.
that shit. he only calls you when he's drunk. don't go over there.
you're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
how do you put up with this greek shit?
shit! it's both of them. the first murders were to throw us - using the same names as woodsboro. but they've moved on- -they're getting closer to sidney. they're not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill. they're looking for the new tatum.
i also know that you're an aging tv reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. a coupla failed relationships with--i'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. but i bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
and deep down i'm a good person? make no mistake, dewey, i'm a shit.
it's a copycat killer i knew this would happen. that fucking movie.
the safety what? fuck that!
you fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
the crowd is really with the movie. some even talk to the screen. "you dumb bitch. get out of the house." etc.
you ass.
well, yeah...she gave me a job. freelance. it got me outta woodsboro. i'm sorry about cotton and yesterday. it was a bad idea. i knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. ah, shit, sid, i'm fucked up. sidney looks at him long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
no, jennifer love hewitt. of course it's me, silly. and i feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
alright i'm here. what the fuck do you want from me?
listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
shit. sarah darling.  i interviewed her too. god, it's happening again isn't it detective?
well i interviewed damon once for the show. he was a real obnoxious fuck. any way, the second one, christine perkins, she had a part in stab 2, didn't she? she was playing cici.
jesus christ you scared the shit out of me.
listen, detective, i wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
fuck!
it was fucking '60 minutes ii'!  i couldn't say no!  i could've been the next diane sawyer!
yes. look, let's get something straight dewey, i got into this shit cause the police came looking for me. not cause i'm out to make the sunrise studios slashings.
this has everything to do with me dewey. i was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. i'll be damned if i'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
bitch.
i dunno but i can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
oh shit it's my cell!
shit! where the hell are tom and angelina?
still that was a much better movie, i saw it at the premiere last week. god, what the hell am i getting sidetracked with this shit for?! we've gotta get down to business.
oh my god karen you scared the shit out of me! what are you doing here?
listen, i have no time for this. i've heard this shit before! so lets get on with it!
oh shit.  hello? director's office.
you sick fuck i'm tracing this call as we speak! the police are gonna nail your ass!
who the fuck is this?
where the fuck did she go?
think about it. on the off chance i get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. you took my mother, so i took yours. big sympathy factor. maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. it certainly fucked you up. it made you have sex with a psychopath.
gotta find me first, you pansy-assed mama's boy.
i'm gonna rip you up bitch. just like your slut whore mother.
not so fast. we're gonna play a little game. it's called guess who just called the police and reported your sorry motherfucking ass?
you bitch -- where the fuck are you?
jesus... fuck, that hurt.
we did your mom a favor, sid. the woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was sharon stone or something.
fuck you.
so... i'm sorry. i've been a selfish shit and i'm sorry.
jesus, shit!
i swear it. and he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
i lied. i do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
no, you listen, you little bitch. if you hang up on me again i'll gut you like a fish. understand?
we gotta get back. jesus. he's here. what the fuck is he doing here?
shit. it's neil prescott's car.
shit.
have to be. the shit she's gone through.
as long as it records i don't give a shit. we're not doing a remote.
i owe you shit.
where do you get this shit?
don't start. you know i don't watch that shit.
fuck you, nut case. where were you last night?
because he's probably dead. his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. see, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch prom night they'd save time. there's formula to it. a very simple one. everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
i think her father did it. how come they can't find his ass?
i'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
you heard billy -- shut the fuck up.
it was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
shit, what is he doing here?
do you believe this shit?
i did. he's full of shit.
we figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
he had a gun.  he had a gun... and he made it happen.  he made me do it!  he made me put that... that thing on.  oh, christ!  he made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  he had the gun in my mouth.
what the fuck is going on?
what the fuck is going on here?!
well... what the fuck, man?
you know he's fucking us.
what the fuck is wrong with you?  what burnt you out?
why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? you bitch and complain... if i thought like you, i would have slit my wrist already.
what the fuck is wrong with you?
no kidding!  no fucking kidding!
i got him.  i got the son-of-a-bitch. see, i was doing really good up till then. lots of street busts.  i've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  i got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  next thing i know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
what the fuck is that?
anyway... i did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  i did all that shit for a long time.
and you are a warwickshire shit-house.
yeah, but you were good, you were really good. fucking bin-bag', i liked that. you were good. you explored your maleness to the full there.
looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
that's right. you're going to rio. rio de janeiro. on your own. come on, you should know. you bought the fucking ticket.
lester, you're a miserable man. you're not helping anybody. you're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. and you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which i can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. you're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
and listen, i'll be right back and i want your ass in that bed when i get back.
shit.
look...  do you wanna fuck me?
no shit.
oh fuck, norman!
-- ass and legs --
fuckin' a --
-- why not? c'mon, take me out of here, somewhere i don't have to lie to anybody and i'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, i adore you --
c'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
that son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, i'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
can i count on that? i just want to see lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
you were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
-- you takin' a lot of shit lately, george.
you did fuck him, didn't you?
you didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
maybe i should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and i'd never clean it up.
wait a minute, god-damn-it. do you think i want to go to some god damned party? i'm trying to get that god damned shop open. i'm trying to get a little bread together. that's all i'm doing.
you'll do what i tell you. now get the fuck inside.
no shit?
i was gonna give you the money. probably i was. shit, i don't know, i don't know anything anymore.
oh, fuck, lester, how should i know?
yeah, little election party i'm giving at the bistro. it's a pain in the ass but -- i have to do it. we'll have a little time to talk there.
a real swinger. he's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
i see. you mean he just sort of fucks you.
hallo, this is dick halloran again. i called a while ago about the folks at the overlook hotel.
hallo.  my name's dick halloran. i'm the head chef up at the overlook hotel.
dick, can we borrow mrs. torrance for a few minutes?  we're on our way through to the basement - i promise we won't keep her very long.
this is dick halloran, our head chef.
oh dick, come on over and say hello to mr. and mrs. torrance.
darling, light of my life, i'm not going to hurt you.  you didn't let me finish my sentence.  i said 'i'm not going to hurt you... i'm just going to bash your brains in!'  i'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
wendy, i have let you fuck up my life so far, but i'm not going to let you fuck this up!
fine.  why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when i am in here that means that i am working - that means don't come in.  now do you think you can handle that?
then i'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  go on, now.
yeah. really. the bitch of it is, we still are. learn from your elders, dearies.
uh-huh. only in her case i guess it would be queen shit of turd mountain. hand me that adjustable.
she and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. jane's walking around like she's king shit of turd mountain. like always.
it's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. not bad, huh? i read sherwood anderson in college. i can jive that shit all day.
yeah.  we all got caught.  shoplifting. cuttin' school.  cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  so we gotta come here.  so we'll be good, in the future.  so we'll learn valuable lessons.  and i learned mine.  i will be incredibly good, i will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  can i go now?
you're gonna be singing for st. peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
you son-of-a-bitch!
no smart-ass remarks or nothing.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. i will be in bed.
damn you, sir!  god damn you to hell!
damn... damn... damn...
you done fixed it? i'll be damned. scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'course scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. you done fixed it. i'll just be damned. see you tomorrow.
well, he's pretty quiet. except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  but boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. that son of a bitch is a regular eli whitney on a lawnmower. loves french fries. eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. i'm proud to have him.
hey freddy, what's goin' on boy. i seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
you're not stayin' here tonight. go get sober before you come back. i'm tired of my child seein' this. now you get yourself straight or i'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
i thought i told everybody to get out of my house. that includes cocksuckers and retards. get off your asses and go.
have a damn party! call morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. i'd like to show that fuckin' karl to the guys. they'd get a kick out of that. don't you know they would.
he had of went nuts and did somethin'. they don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. they's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. do you know, frank?
he's just mentally retarded, i guess.
well, i hate you, too. no i don't. i love your mama. nobody understands what i go through. i'll leave. you bunch of freaks have fun. i'll call you tomorrow honey. i'm sorry. you can kiss my ass, really.  you ever hit me again you little bastard and i'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
what have you got to be nervous about? you're a damn kid. you ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
yeah, honey, let the kid watch t.v. hell, let's all watch t.v. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
no sir's right. i'm talkin' to your mama. this is your mama's decision, not yours. i'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause i have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. just like i am about antique furniture and midgets. i can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. same thing with a droolin' retard.
well, honey, i don't guess i give a shit. i ain't here half the time anyway. if you want a retard livin' in the garage, i don't guess i care. i've got a good tool box and socket set out there i don't want stol'd. i guess i could take it home with me.
you got that shit right.
come on, don't be a pussy. everybody has to work.
i heard you was more than friends. i heard dick rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old mizz ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
i told you to get away from here, didn't i? i'm tryin' to relax and look at tv.  what are you doin' with that piece of iron? i swear to god you're the weirdest son of a bitch i ever heard of.
you shut up you, fuckin' retard. get your shit and get out of here.  that was a wake-up slap, frank. remember. reality, like i said. don't forget any bit of what i said to you and we'll be fine.
baptized? well, get baptized then. i don't give a shit. call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! i can't baptize you.
on the bass, give it up for terence "one ball" atkins.  on the tambourine and lyrics morris hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  on drums "the johnson."  and last and most importantly, doyle hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. come on, a big hand for these guys. they're workin' their asses off here.  okay i'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. to my lovely female companion linda, her lovely son frank, our new boarder karl - what's your last name karl?
you're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  it wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause i ain't afraid of shit. you think i'm afraid for you to stay here. you're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. not really, i'm just jokin' with you. welcome to our humble home, buddy. frank needs all the friends he can get. frank's a real weak little kid. his daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
well, i can't understand none of it. this one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. just how retarded are you?
you have to karl. you have to look out for me. you don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
just diggin'.  i ain't ever gonna be happy now. not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. i wish me and you and mama could just run away. but she said he would find us wherever we went. he's crazy. sometimes i think it would of been better if i wadn't ever born.
i'd like to kill that son of a bitch. i hate him.
frank told me about your situation. and frank loves company. you know, especially after his daddy passed and all. there ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  he's mentally retarded, poor thing.
it's all right.  you know i was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. she's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. well, you know, she's slow. she's a little bit, i think. she's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. i thought you might like to meet her. vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. would you like that?
he's retarded's all. you know he's always after a father figure and lord knows doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
do you smell shit?
shit. if you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
fuck you, kid.
don't be an ass, auggie. he's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
yeah, well, i'm sorry too.  it took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now i'm broke. i can't hardly pay for this beer. not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. do you understand what i'm saying? my credibility. so yeah, i'm sorry, too. about as sorry as i've ever been in my whole fucking life.
fuck this angel shit. just take the dough, ruby. but no bawling, okay? i can't stand people who blubber.
her name is felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  she ran away from pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in brooklyn with a guy named chico. strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  i can't bear to think about that baby. our grandchild, auggie. just think of it. our grandchild.
you always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? a little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
no i'm not. i look like shit. and so do you, ruby. you look just awful.  what's with the patch, anyway? what'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
shit. you should have been married to someone by now. you know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
you're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
your job? you've got five thousand bucks. what do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
shit. i don't want your money, you little twerp.  it's probably stolen anyway.
seventeen? i remember when i was seventeen. christ, i was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when i was seventeen. is that what you are, son? one little whacked-out crazy fella?
jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
that's how it is with sidewalks. people come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. as soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
and nothing. thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "i don't have a father. as far as i'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
son-of-a-bitch. you're some piece of work, aren't you?
help? what the fuck do i need your help for? i've got a man, don't i? that's more than you can say for yourself, hawkeye.
they didn't have to do a thing, that's all i'm saying. the team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. but then they had to screw it up.  they traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  a mess of porridge.
okay, joke about it. i don't give a shit.
management. those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
i pay auggie, and i've got nothing. eight hundred bucks and a ticket to shit city.
i am a bastard.  i'm a big hun nazi son of a bitch.  and i still got your bamboo fishing rod.
well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  they <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?

yeah, but you know, i learned something today.  i learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... you all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... to love each other.
no, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
hey, cartman, did they put that v-chip in your head or your ass?

what do you think this is kid?  lick barney the dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour?  huh?  this is real life with consequences you take to the grave!
will you two please stop it!  i don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
well blaze your ass out of there! you've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
you're not helping my heart condition any, barnes!  now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
well don't drag your ass.  there won't be much of a window for us to link up.  we'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
like that piece of ass he was with.
fat chance of that.  even if we had c4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  that son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
i should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
you got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
he'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
fuck you and fuck bowling.
i'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. i deal with my own shit. i ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
what the fuck is this?
i'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
you might say i'm at the top of their shit list.
suck my dick!
fuck plan c!
why should i help that old fuck.
no "buts".  if he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  hello?  yes, the subs -- i want a report...  hello...  yes, a report. gimme... shit.
off the record, i don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
well, where the fuck is he?
fuck him.  what?  hello?
well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
we're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
i'm not fucking with you, norman. you've fucked yourself.
don't fuck with me, beth.
i don't know, beth.  i'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. but it can.  when harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  how he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  then you found the book, remember in your lab.  then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
damn it, norman!  he's lying.  don't you get it?  there is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  why can't you believe me?
he's not just a navy captain -- he works for the fucking pentagon.
fuck you, norman!  it's right here...
pussy.
i'm trying.  shit.  here -- catch her.
don't gimme that psychology bullshit, norman.  psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  it's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. with an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
shutup, ted.  you didn't notice shit. keep hammering.
sure, why not.  give him the trophy. that pretentious son of a bitch.  you heard him, norman.  all that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  and "impotent".  where does he get off saying i'm impotent?  he's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
he's a pussy.
hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
kill the bitch.
of course you don't. i doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
carbon units have clearly retarded enterprise's proper evolvement.
if your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  how long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
kiss my ass.
you're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
i don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
and my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
you know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  in front of the whole <u>world</u>? frosty, the snow bitch!!
with good reason.  they fucking worship you as it is.
now, 'limp dick', i know.  what. is 'snowballing'?
i think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
i really look like shit.
you're damn right.  i'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  i never said i was betty fucking crocker.  if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third friday or the month -- go ahead!  i have a life!
man, i am out of here! this family is so fucked!
that's not fair! i was honest! just because i wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch catherine.
patronizing fuck! if you had just been honest with me in the first place i wouldn't have read it. i knew it was shit. but - idiot! - i believed you!
what the fuck are you talking about? what's ok?
tired of this shit...

fuck me hard!
'fuck me hard!'

we got trouble.  that bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
listen man, i don't need this shit--
go fuck yourself...
the ball is in richter's court.  but we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
you're fucking crazy richter--you know that?
what are you so worked up about jack? fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
how much of this shit do they have, white!!
damn it!  damn it!  i've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.

so you and i can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the sizzler? what are we doing, jeff? you and me?

that is a damn lie and you know it. every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer get junior to do it. every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell junior to do it. boy, you ought to grow up.
i appreciate you lending me a hand. that lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
rush your mouth, girl. no, he didn't. he cannot be that big of a damn fool.
none of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual drug czar.
tell me what to do, carl.  i need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  i'm not bringing a child into the kind of life i grew up with.  i won't do it.  i want our life back.
like i give a fuck.
maradona is a cokehead.  hand of god, my ass.  we're wasting our time here.
i'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
it's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  why do women wear makeup and perfume?
the worst thing about you, monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. i wish you could see how transparent you are.  this food tastes like shit.
nobody said shit, eduardo --
go home.  get cleaned up.  get to work.  salazar is heading down to mexico city next week and i'm not getting left behind.  don't fuck this up.
who the fuck do you think you are? where the fuck do you think you are? why the fuck do you think i shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
this is a business.  get the fuck outta here.
you want to help?  stay the fuck away from her.
the west end.  we buy it off the streets.  i can stop, you know, and she can't. two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then i get my shit together, and for her it's different --
i don't give a fuck about your parents --
apparently not.  look, it's a shit storm here right now.  when are you coming back?  i don't know what to tell people any more.
because i fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
bit fucking late, like.
it's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
it's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
you daft cunt. if you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. now get the drinks in.
sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
all down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
for fuck's sake.
not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
for four fucking grand?  one palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
this was his nightmare. the dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. i knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in london and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. he had to. if he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in saughton.
yes, you fucking do. i've seen your statement.
i'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
too right it is. now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos i'm fucking lee marvin, by the way.
i didn't either. what the fuck is it?
exactly. i'm not wanting a cat, she says. get to fuck, right. so there's tommy stuck with this kitten. you can imagine what happened. the thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. he didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
returned it? where? to the video shop, tommy? to the fucking video store? so every punter in edinburgh is jerking off to our video? god, tommy, i feel sick.
fuck, ok.
no problem.  no problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
it's a tightrope, spud, a fucking tightrope.
and you might get the fucking job.
if they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. first hint of that, they'll be on to the dss, 'this cunt's no trying' and your giro is fucking finished, right?
come on, mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in london.
about four kilos. so he tells me. got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two russian sailors. they're fucking carrying the stuff. for sale there and then, like. so he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. wants rid of this. {---------- he's looking for swanney to punt it, but swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
it was my fucking television.
fuck you.
fuck you. ok, so tommy's got the virus. bad news, big deal. the gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? swanney fucks his leg up. well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
and i got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
oh, fuck. sick boy reaches out to allison.
yeah, beautifully fucking illustrated.
that means fuck all. the sympathy vote.
roald dahl. fuck me.
fuck off! he never wrote any of them.
the only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -
big time. absolutely fucking radge. 'it's me or iggy pop, time to decide.'
forgive you? i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
you bitch.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  bright boy alert.  repeat, a bright boy alert.  and i need a patch of the white house asap. that's right--
oh shit.  harry... what're you doing?
son of a bitch!
hey, did that guy harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
son of a bitch!
there is no us, you psychotic bitch.
oh shit.
i don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  you should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
you son of a bitch.  did you really think you could elude us forever, carlos?
so you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  i couldn't do it.
what're we talking about here? pussy, right?
fuck you.
hi, dick. i'm alabama worley.
i used to live by one back in dearborn. it's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. i hated where i was, but i couldn't do anythin' about it. i didn't have enough money. it was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here i was livin' next to an airport. whenever i went outside, i saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. all day long i'm seein', hearin' people doin' what i wanted to do most, but couldn't.
ya know, i used to fuckin' hate airports.
i'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. then i'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch x-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
you were chillin', kind of creepy even. you totally fucked with his head. i'm gonna go grab dinner.
you don't know me. not when it comes to shit like this. i have to do this. i need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. now write down the address.
you better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
you better not be fucking teasing me.
thank you. i wanna see you again too. and again, and again, and again. bama, i know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. so, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
goddamn it, alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! how much longer before he's slappin' you around? punchin' you in the stomach? how the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
it's over on the tv. all it says is: "dear clarence." i couldn't write anymore. i didn't not want to ever see you again. in fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. las night... i don't know... i felt... i hadn't had that much fun since girl scouts. so i just said, "alabama, come clean, let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to drexl and fuck yourself."
well, we sell other things too. cool stuff. "man from u.n.c.l.e." lunch boxes. "green hornet" board games. shit like that. but comic books are main business. there's a lot of collectors around here.
sonny kicks ass.
does sonny kick ass or does sonny kick ass?
he ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. sonny don't be bullshittin'. he fucks dudes up for life. hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
what a wonderful philosophy. thanks for being such a sweetheart. you could have been a real dick.
well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. what would taste good.  what do you think would taste good?
shit! nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. so you won't eat pussy? motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
what the fuck are you talkin' about?
take that shit somewhere else.
ain't no man have to eat pussy!
you don't like it, but you eat that shit.  he eats it.
so you do eat pussy!
go on pussy-eaters... laugh. you look like you be eatin' pussy. you got pussy-eatin' mugs. now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
nigger, i eat everything. i eat pussy. i eat the butt. i eat every motherfuckin' thang.
hold on a second, big d. you sayin' you eat pussy?
that's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
you're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
you don't think i'm kissin' his ass, do you?
with that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? and gettin' away with it every day. are you haunted?
fuck you! my mother was apache.
no thanks? what does that mean? means you ate before you came down here? all full. is that it? naw, i don't think so. i think you're too scared to be eatin'. now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. i'm still a mystery to you. but i know exactly where your ass is comin' from. see, if i asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, i'd say to myself, "this motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. who know? maybe he don't. maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my chinese, watch my tv." see? you ain't even sat down yet. on that tv there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. you just been starin' at me. now, i know i'm pretty, but i ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
well. that makes us practically related. bring your ass on in.
who the fuck are you?
where the fuck is that bitch?
well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
what the fuck did you bring that for.
ah, dick, let's talk about it in the car. we can't be late.
no shit? dick, that's great!
yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  come on, clarence, lets go. elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
don't expect me to be all broken up over poor drexl. i think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. i got no pity for a mad dog like that. i think i should get a merit badge or somethin'.
two guys. now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. fuck, clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
i don't know! a fuckin' lot!
do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
it's fuckin' real!  it's fuckin' real!
this shit can't be real.
get the fuck outta here!
get the fuck outta here!
when he was alive. i wouldn't fuck him now.
i'd fuck elvis.
mr. donowitz?  i told you, through dick.  he's in my acting class.  about a year.  yeah, he's good.  they grew up together.  sure thing.
riddle me this, batman. if you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? i'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play joe fuckin' hollywood till the wheels come off. he can sell it, he can snort it, he can play santa claus with it. at the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. and, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. i'm not puttin' him down. hey, let him run wild. have a ball, it's his money. but, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like french vanilla ice-cream?
we were in four h together. we've known each other since childhood. so, i'm handling the sales part. he's my silent partner and he knows if i get fucked up, i won't drop dime on him. i didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
no problem, elliot. i'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. actually, i'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. understand, if dick didn't assure me you're good people i'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. but, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: i gotta friend in the department.
look, dick, i don't -
you know, i saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. but, i look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. i ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. man, i was ever wrong.
if you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
well, elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  thanks a lot, bigmouth. i knew you were a squid the moment i laid eyes on you. in my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  he's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. he just saw his chance and he took it.
you know, most movies that win a lot of oscars, i can't stand. "sophie's choice", "ordinary people", "kramer vs. kramer", "gandhi". all that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. remeber, you got a wife to think about. quit fuckin' around.  i love you son.
gangster. drug dealer. somebody you don't want on your ass. look, clarence, the more i hear about this drexl fucker, the more i think you did the right thing. that guy wasn't just some wild flake.
no shit?
apparently, drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
look, goddamnit, i never asked you for a goddamn thing! i've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. after mom divorced you, did i ask you for anything? when i wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? no, it was always "ok", "no problem", "you're a busy guy, i understand". the whole time you were a drunk, did i ever point my finger at you and talk shit? no! everybody else did. i never did. you see, i know that you're just a bad parent. you're not really very good at it. but i know you love me. i'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. if i didn't really need it i wouldn't ask. and if you say no, don't worry about it. i'm gone. no problems.
could you find out if they know anythin'? i don't know they know shit about us. but i don't wanna think, i wanna know. you could find out for sure what's goin' on.  daddy?
daddy, i'm in big fuckin' trouble and i really need your help.
that's of minor importance. but what's of major fuckin' importance is that i believe you. where did they go?
i have a son of my own. about you boy's age. i can imagine how painful this must be for you. but clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. and i implore you not to go down the road with 'em. you can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
i'm glad. hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-i-am question you've been asking yourself. now, we're gonna have a little q and a, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  want a chesterfield?
that was a good fuckin' movie.
okee-dokee. it's like this, krinkle a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. so they bring his ass in and me an' nicholson go to work on him.
both you, idiots shut up, i can't understand shit! now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
how the fuck could he know?
so we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. and, krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
nicholson and i go to work on him. now er know somthing's rotten in denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. scarin' the shit outta him.
krinkle, this is it. we got it, man. and it's all ours. i mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. you shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, i'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
'course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. pussy just won't feed right anymore -
you got caught. it's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. but now we gotcha. ok, mr. elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
no don't sit here and feed us some shit.
but a fuckin' baggie.
i'll keep lover boy here entertained.  you know the first thing i'll do when she gets here. i think i'll make her suck my dick, and i'll come all in her face. i mean it ain't nuttin' new. she's done it before. but i want you as a audience.  marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
pussy love pink rocks.
looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with cherry seven-up.
you ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. they ass be young man. they got that fine young pussy. bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. they give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
with that terrible mug of yours if jayne kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
you tell jayne kennedy to fuck it?
i tell jayne kennedy, "suck my dick or i'll beat your ass!"
why you trippin'? we jus' fuckin' with ya. but i wanna ask you a question. you with some fine bitch, i mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with jayne kennedy. you're with jayne kennedy and you say "bitch, suck my dick!" and then jayne kennedy says, "first things first, nigger, i ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" now, what do you say?
well fuck you guys then! you guys are fucked up!
then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. and because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.
yeah, that's right, laugh. it's so funny, oh it's so funny.  there used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. and white boys are freaks for that shit -
look here. if i ever did eat some pussy - i would never eat any pussy - but, if i did eat some pussy, i sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. i'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
naw man, that's some serious shit.
naw man, i don't be eatin' that shit.
i'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
fuck! i knew it! i fucking knew it! i should have my head examined, driving like this!  kandi, you gotta help me.
hello, is dick ritchie here?
are you dick ritchie?
she's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... i don't know what you're up to this time, mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
no it won't.  you just don't know shit about statistics.
goddamn you!  you son of a bitch!
you son of a bitch!
now that's too bad.  i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
that's a ford, not a ferrari.  you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford?
that's about an hour and a half longer than i usually spend looking for parts.  you're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  what you expect but fancy damn prices?
'cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  that's when she started shooting.  can't blame her. the ring was all carlos left her when he died.
fuck you!  do you hear me, john!? fuck you!  john . . . john!?
i think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  but it's nice to know you care.
i know.  he was to take the fucking money.
you're crazy, you know that!? you're fucked up!?
because i know you're full of shit.
shit!
one-hundred-thousand!?  that son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
you're right.  i don't give a damn about her.  but to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  that just makes a fool out of him.  i don't like being made a fool of.
this morning i didn't know how badly i'd want to get out of this fucking town.
i bet she led you on good, didn't she?  taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  then me busting in like some wild bear.  bet you had a fire going under you.
i wasn't going to fight for you.  i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
that country shit all sounds the same to me.
get up, mister!  don't ever let it be said toby tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
oh, shit!
do you understand me you little fuck?
you bitch!  you were in on it froom the start!
just cool down, son.  i ain't accusing you of anything.  serves toby right to get his ass whooped. if you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. this town's all inbreeding.
all them miners last century. hungry ghosts, killed off all the indians. up at the mine. earth ran red with blood, think i'm fooling around here. white sky was on fire. grown men cried like babies. i saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. they put me in the joint. took my eyes. i cursed them. white people can't seem to stay away from indians . you gotta watch where ya put your fingers. pussy pussy pussy, indian pussy.
i'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  i'm stompin' your ass.
oh, shit!
that's my gun... that fucking darrell!
no, i hate loving her. i hate the kind of person she is. i hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. the bitch. she loved to play. she wants me to hit her and when i hit her she likes it. she tortures me. but she's family. she's my little girl. my baby. i couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. no. not me. but you? you got the killing in you, boy...how much you want?
after you huffed off, grace lied so bad, i got so pissed off, i pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. sorry i lost my cool like that. it's a funny thing, women.
what the fuck do you want?
i wasn't going to fight for you.  i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
that country shit all sounds the same to me.
what the fuck did you do to my trunk?
i don't give a fuck! i didn't tell you to do it!  you can't just do unauthorized work.
what sign? fuck the sign. i want my car.
you son of a bitch! i'll have my lawyers shut you down.
now that's too bad.  i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
that's a ford, not a ferrari.  you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford?
actually, it's been about three hours. you're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  what you expect but fancy damn prices?
i think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. but it's nice to know you cared...
when you're finished with me, i'm next! i been there, baby. i been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. i'll take you as far as california. if we can make that. after that you're on your own. try mexico. with all this bread, you can live like a queen.
don't you really want to know? was jake my daddy? was i fucking my own daddy? don't you want to know that?
ask you what? you mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
the only deal he had in mind was killing you for jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
because i know you're full of shit.
one-hundred-thousand!?  that son-of-a-bitch.
he <u>was</u> a shaman...in the mine. we had nothin' after he died. jake took us in, gave us a little money. he used to call me his "little halfbreed"... he kept mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. he had kids in phoenix i think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. he loved to do things to me. believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
grace, i've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  you're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
shit i'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain i'm under. i'm just under a lot of strain here.
...now, let me get this straight. two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
i'll fuckin' take it. to go.
no.  just plain ol' miller. now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
son of a bitch!
you fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
yeah, i heard a key slapping against my ass.
you broke her heart! you broke your mama's heart. you stole me! that's right. fuck it away. but it ain't ever goin' away, cause your mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
ya little bitch, you like it don't you! you like it this way -- rough and hard. gotta go fuck around on me, like your mama, but you always gotta come home to daddy, don't you, cause you know daddy's the best.

you just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
if they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
what did you think, they come clear up from kansas to fuck us?
ha. he was building his fucking porch.
some big guy beat the shit out of me.  i guess i must look a lot like you, huh?

oh, shit, bill, i guess nobody's gonna come clear from texas.
shit, skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
you figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
"deserve" don't mean shit, little bill.
huh? oh.  another one, huh? shit, i guess i'm clean out of receptacles.
bam! that walker colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. now if corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
some folks did call old corky "two gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that walker colt he carried. an' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some french lady that old bob was sweet on... well, one day corky walked into the blue bottle and before he knows what's happening bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
a cowboy come in sayin' you killed quick mike in the shit house at the bar t...
h-hell yeah. i killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
shit... i thought they was gonna get us. i was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  was you ever scared in them days?
well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
shit!
like i was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
ned, don't pay no mind to what the kid said about the money. i'll bring your share along, hear? the kid's full of shit, hear?
shit, ned, this ain't the time to quit.
last night i said i missed my fuckin' wife... tonight i just miss my fuckin' bed.
i give it up 'cause i hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  shit, i sure do miss my fuckin' bed.

forget it.  i'11 probably shit blood tonight.
don't jerk me off. we all know what this is. you don't work with me if i work with you without knowing who i'm working for. now let's cut the shit. who's the man?
i hear you did time with old spook. yeah, he was a good egg. i used to run a lot of dope for him. fuckin' shame he got shivved.
which is shit.
what'the fuck is that?
the d.a. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the d.a. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. they took his statement and cut him a deal.
you know what it's like, agent kujan, to know you'll never be good? not good like you. you got good all fucked around. i mean a stand up guy. i grew up knowing i was never going to be good at anything 'cause i was a cripple. shit, i wasn't
mcmanus was furious. he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. that night we got the call.
i came clean. i told it like it happened on the boat. so what if i left out how i got there? it's got so many holes in it, the d.a. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. so you got what you wanted out of me. big fucking deal.
not from me, you piece of shit. there is no immunity from me. you atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. every criminal i have put in prison,
keaton was a piece of shit.
damn right i'm done.  i'm going to ask for a mistrial and i'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. i'm going to take a transcript to the state and ask that they impeach your ass.
and don't give me this shit, 'i was a lawyer, too.'  'cause i know who you were.  you couldn't hack it as a lawyer. you were bag man for the boys and you still are.  i know who you are.
no, no, you listen to me.  all i wanted in this case is an even shake.  you rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, i can't get a continuance, and i don't give a damn.  i'm going up there and i'm going to try it.  let the jury decide.  they told me sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  i don't care.  i said, the hell with it.  the hell with it. i'll take my chances he'll be fair.
oh shit, what's today?
...he's a good man...?  he's the prince of fuckin' darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her tuesday on a surfboard at hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
one lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .i try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
fuck you.  i got a call today from sally doneghy ...
i don't want to leave her.  dick ...the, the ... and father laughlin, he said that it was god's will ...
... we, we love her, dick and me ...
oh, damn it! damn it, damn it --
bullshit it's not accesory. i didn't do shit. you call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
she's fucking hot!
don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
you fucking bastard!
you got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
eat my ass!
and you're a little fucking reject.
what are you fucking talking about?
i'm talking about dna samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, fbi scientists. they figure this shit out. they always figure it out.
i didn't do anything! i'll turn your pathetic ass in!
you got some mighty fucking fine bad timing adam. we got a rehearsal situation here.
fuck you boyd!
oh i did? i think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play hamburger helper with the hooker's head.
boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
so i didn't fucking do it!
her fucking head was caved in.
she's got no fucking pulse.
one idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
i got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, mike tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
no. i think it's fucked.
sin city. devil's playground. the black bitch. all day every day.  where's tina?
what's your fucking point?
and if you think you can fuck me, don't. cause i'm fucking insulated fisher. protected. backed up on floppy. do you get me? i want my fucking money!
blood money. insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. in no way have you mentioned that money. and i find that to be very very offensive.
i'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. bad things! those are bad fucking things!
suck my ass.
what's insane is the fact that micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. that's insane.
fuck! fuck you fucking guys!
a little gut check time fellas. a time for some serious self-exploration. how do i function? for real? no more bullshit. can i keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? when they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. do you get me? do you get me?
it's my fucking opinion.
you're a fucking moron.
i told boyd two fucking minutes!
you fucked a prostitute?
cancel?! cancel?! are you out of your fucking mind?!
you're going to be hungover for three days. like those guys on "oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
i'm working my ass off here. i've taken care of absolutely everything keith.
i'm just so scared of that song. that fucking, "my son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. i got lots of bills come again next day. he's grown up just like me...my boy is just like me." gordon fucking lightfoot, cat stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
i could have done it better. i'm a fucking ball-buster i am.
mike brenn. yes. yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. at 29.83 at 9.  i'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
boyd...i don't know man...it just seems to me that ever since you took tony robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
fucking desert.
that will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
he's lying through his ass!
real, my ass. it's an overblown game.  anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
in other words, we collectively don't know shit.
get that fucking thing away from me!
did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
what we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
naa, fuck this, this is nothing.  oh, lord -- this just got <u>big</u>.  i see it -- <u>big</u> -- big for <u>you</u> and big for <u>me</u>.
...got to be <u>something</u>.  she gives him the sacred...  and tells him:  this is the traditional harvest offering, given to the man who ties the first sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
s'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  do you think we could line him up for the peace prize?
how you going to stretch it?  this won't hold for eleven days.  guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
what the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "what kind of stuff?"?
gimme a break. you buy bluestar airlines yesterday. today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. you must have esp. a real nostradamus.  jesus christ, what are friends for?
problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to florida next month... west coast, near tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
mixed emotions, buddy: like larry wildman going off a cliff in my new maserati. men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
...just kickin' ass and taking names, mr. mannheim.
oh i don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  he doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  you know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
forget her mark, she's a bitch
i think playing in a band called "bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
give me that shit.  your wife.
and i kicked ass.  my best stuff.  then i stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and i cried.
and there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in finnish.
i had just been left by richard.  i was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
so you fucked a student?!
why don't you shut up and fuck me, professor.
and he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "doctor spencer, i am a great admirer of your work..."
don't give me shit - what do you want?
i'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. but this is different.  she wasn't your mother mother--
this isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. there are no wild sex orgies.
and like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
nobody knows about your mental retardation.
he kicked major ass and you know it.
but just for the record, my mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the himalayas. you seem to have forgotten they opened nelson's family market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. their kids.
you've got enough people kissing your ass.
is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release?
don't say "shit," honey. use the strong vocabulary god gave you.
i need your help.  i'm really in deep shit.
a statue in front of city hall, dedicated to principal dick merkin?
that's great.  i'll just tell my creditors i'm not a rapist.  no problem... shit.  i can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  they see out the sides.  that one don't even know walter's arm's in his mouth.
he's leaving the country.  and i don't give a shit.
this is where she lives.  she wants to talk.  beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  i busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at camp nine.
yeah, well, van ryan got his.  i don't imagine he gives a shit now.
he said, "no little bitch can ever make me come."
you didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
suzie toller's.  and that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
i fucked up.  i lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... god, what did i do?
shit, what difference does it make... nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
shit.
are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
you're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
yeah, i've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  right?  and sam.  believe me, suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  he's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  stay strong and he can't do shit.
okay.  i want you to hear this too. we've got to be cool.  all of us. people think i'm rich, for christ's sake.   i'm doing what rich guys do.  i'm spending my money.  it's more suspicious if i sit around doing nothing.  now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
shit.  i was afraid of that.  she left this garbled message on my machine.  can you calm her down?
god, you scared the shit out of me.  you must be crazy coming here.
sound nice?  it's a fucking drug rehab farm.  it's where kelly van ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  meanwhile, you get educator of the year i mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  reason?  they're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  now tell me i'm right.
i know how deep her pockets are, ken.  i thought i might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
suzie, suzie... this is me, ray, you're talking to.  we both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
you ought to watch it with that shit, suzie.  you get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
it's celine.  he's okay.  he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
the bitch shot me, is what happened.
fuck you.  this is bullshit.  i'm outta here.
i've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man van ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  what if i told you i had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
fuck the winch.  i wanna drive.
shit. here we go again.
oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
"spontaneous."  i like that.  most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
maybe the bureau. or those bastards at treasury. i'll take care of it.  i hate this shit, johnny. you cut their balls off for me. i'm counting on you.
good. take care of that woman's name for me. and watch your ass.
johnny, what the fuck?
listen, i don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
they don't have any shit.
weird, man. no fuckin' electricity. what do you figure they plug all their shit into?
ho -- ho --ho -- ho
ho -- ho --ho
hnnrr.  -- like to masturbate.  shit once a day.
you ruthless son of a bitch.  you really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
that detroit shit?  i'm so worried.
. . . and they call me a fucking nut.
are you saying that someone would risk starting world war iii just to get back at us?  what about all those poor shits with cancer?
i don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
what the hell am i after? you're telling me dick.
you're one sick bastard. a sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. i think no matter which way i go i'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. so here's my answer: kiss my ass, hop-along.
it's a stakeout suit. it's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. it's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
first of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. two, i don't wanna be here either, so just step off. three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. now that we've got that sorted out, i'm gonna get some rest.
you're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. this is an internal affair, a czech affair, that you are interfering with. i will warn you once: don't shit in my lawn. get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
easy. you get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
screw the world. if i'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
it's all this craziness! it's what we've been living since 99, when we left the army. one of our brothers died in grozny and we said the hell with this shit. what for? he dies for what? politics? who's politics? not ours.
we seen all your shit! so you want cars? we get whatever cars you need. what are you looking for?
oh, shit.
