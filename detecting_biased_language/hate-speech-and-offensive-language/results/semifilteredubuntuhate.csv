i need to kill x and keep it killed
i played trailers with mplayer but the screen of the trailer on the right part is cut off

irc is racist ... why is it black on white ... why not white on black :p

i've been fucking with everything in the preferences menu and nautilus for ages . i can't find anything . how would my imagination help ?
i've been killing x ... should i kill this gdm instead ?
i've been recently informed by my campus network admin that my server has tried to send email without using a campus server 509 times in the last 18 hours . as i have not recently installed any software and most certainly have not tried to send email from this server , how might i go diagnosing this problem ? i am relatively new to linux , so this is quite vexing .
ive got a linux box that comes with some stupid custom kernel thats being a total pain in the ass , whats the easiest way to install a standard server kenel ?
ive tried killing it and force killing it . nothing ..
i want to stream from apple trailers , i shouldnt really have to ?
i want to watch movie trailers on apple.com

lol yeah i'm a student worker at a campus it services and i'm like one of 3 people that 's every used ubuntu
looking for a black and white theme to be printed in a train hard book , because book is black&white
lost is a shitty show . its season 6 and theyre still on a fucking island .. i think a better story would be , they live in the jungle for like 2 seasons , and during that time they turn into savage killers from living like guerillas in the jungle .. so then they finally get rescued , but when they go back to civilized life theyre all traumatized from life in the jungle and having to eat eachothers guts . and now , they cannot cope with so
maybe my friend needs to set up a web forum , because they are asking the same fucking questions over and over
mit doesn't like ppl using ipv6 on campus cuz they dont really use it and it would just be another thing to support

my glxgears seems fucked .. it looked like it is locked at 25fps or something and never shows any results ... i get nice 3d perfomance from 3d games like ut though
my isp won't care if i'm fucking around with a bunch of 14 year old faggots on irc . they certainly won't take my connection away because of your whining . and oh yeah this is a proxy lol !!!!
my uncle is gonna kill me .
my window border theme is set to human , but it 's blue , i thought human was brown ?

no , i'm using a campus computer
no im watching trailers on apple.com
nope . on apple 's trailer site , the plugin appears and displays " no plugin to handle this movie "
not being racist just stupid in general
not having a task bar should not be a choice . its like saying the jews under hilter " had a choice " to leave germany
no there are different interrupt levels kill by itself try 's to kill the process nicely asking it to close itself
not within college campus or business network ?
not yet , thinking about it though .. stupid whore that she is : x

oh , and happy " dead things " and " dress like a whore day "
oh , boy , think of freedom , as the borned right of human !
okay i am about kill my unbuto and start over ... any good ideas on killing it ?
ok i have a stupid question . say a program freezes up . is there a command or a way to kill a program like say firefox freezes in windows you would ctrl alt del and open up task manager and kill it is there a way to do that with nix ?
ok , i installed the nvidia driver , it told me to restart x . i restarted x , it was fucked up . so i disabled nvidia and tried to start x again , still fucked up . so i restored the backup file manually and am here on a 21 " screen with 1024x768 and wondering if i am actually a " human being "
ok , no need then . maybe contact the admins on your campus ?
ok , so i'm on my wife 's college campus ( i attend another one that this campus is affiliated with ) i've used my laptop here before , the wifi connected almost immediately . but i can't get it to view any sites , download updates , or anything like that . it 's almost as though i have no connection .
ok so my bt homehub is being a regular faggot cutting off when im doing things on the net are there any methods i can use to resolve this issue pls
ok you have a windows linux dualboot machine , how do you repair windows iwthout fucking up linux

please shut the fuck upppp , i forget it
poor flannel , you cannot decide where you are born , but you can decide where you live and where you die
possibly apple trailers should work no ? well they wont
prada and gucci and other fag shit
probably because they're child processes of your shell process , so when you kill your shell process ( by logging out ) they get killed .

since deskbar forces a white background for my theme 's white fonts :(
since #vmware are fags ! maybe you can answer . why is it not ' legal ' to run a mac os vm ?
since you are on campus , check around for a linux users group ... almost every university has one ... they'd be ideal for help you setup your server
so does my university ... my university has a campus agreement with my university
so how do i kill process that killall wont kill ?
so i had to disconnect campus connections in favour of modem so i could get to you guys
so , make this your command to kill it : kill `pgrep azureus`
somebody fucking help me please .
sometime u have to be serious with what ur doing not everyone is to be joked cuz this password irritates me then i post my querry here then u make a joke i say fuck u

taking your news from slashdot , which is being taken from ms pr whores , is the equivalent of eating from a dumpster at a chemical factory .
tell your teach to fuck off
thanks for the reply , surely the amd64 version is compiled for the amd set of chips ? or am i missing something , sorry typing with fag in had .
that could work , but there are a lot of access points here ( college campus ) and only 1 i know of that doesn't work
that just means to kill it immediately , rather than sending a kill signal and waiting for it to finish on it 's own before dying . :)
that'll kill it once , i'd like to kill it forever
thats a lame ass response
thats fucking beautiful considering i have no mouse
that should work for the quicktime trailers
that 's ok , it just gives me another option before throwing in the towel .
that stop command doesn't just kill every process with a certain name .. it kills the process it started earlier .. so if you've run the vsftp program yourself it won't kill it for you .. afaik
that 's true isn't it ... i just watched a bunch of trailers at apple.com last nite and there was no buffering screen . i know the screen you mean though .
that way if you fuck something up or overwrite some of the data of the copy you still have the original to do start again
that will allow me to watch the trailer in firefox ?
that would always kill alsa for me , so i kill jackd and then everything works
the 9 should kill all processes that can be killed
the kill command is blocked when i tried to kill whiptail . what should i do ?
, the kill kills
then during the partioning it just says killed killed killed killed over and over and over again
then perhaps you could try and find out what it can do for you , rather than calling it retarded and tell people to shut up . you can do with sudo anything that you can do by logging into a root account , and just as easily .
then someone should fucking make one and stop blaming some music player that has nothing to do with that , and shouldn't have anything to do with that .
then you'll probably need to kill x , should kill all the child processes
there is exactly one essid for the campus wifi .
there is no error because technically the process is killed , it just hasn't been reaped . killing the parent process will make the process a child of init , which will then reap it . be certain though that the parent process is something you're willing to kill ( and again , zombies don't really hurt anything )
there is so many people upgrading and downloading the new version that the main server for israel may be overloaded so try another one
there 's pkill or kill in a terminal .. there 's also xkill where you click on a window to kill the app
there will always be chinks in the armor so to speak . i was sleepy when i was reading and don't remember the particulars . but yeik makes an interesting statement
the screen goes to black , white , red , green , blue , white , gray , darker gray , and then black again . anything wrong ?

this more or less is what i used for my campus back in the day

ubuntu is bloated just like that fat nigger sitting on a grease covered recliner on the corner of 3rd and lamar
ubuntu will have to think of a new name ... instead of for humanity ... it will stand for " we are here to fuck you over with our new drm'd kernels in breezy to activate your tpm modules "

you and my 6 other friend on campus have the same issue . they can't play poker .

you are evil , boy ! ati is the only chink in nvidia 's dominating armour , the monopoly that it has over the grpahics card industry !
you can do ctrl+alt+backspace to kill the xserver , but that will kill all running programs , so only use if its really screwed . you can also switch to another vt and kill the malfunctioning process
