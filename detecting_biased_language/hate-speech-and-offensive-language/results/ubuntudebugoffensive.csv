then again , fedora core is a bloated piece of shit )
alright , so i upgraded hoary today and gnome proceeded to shit all over itself and crash , and now all i get when i login through gdm or start up things with startx is a brown background and a cursor , nothing else
the update was also a bitch to apply because of conflicts with some kde packages i had installed .
but they don't get bitch at for doing so .. that 's the differance
damn it works now what the hell lol
see , vp **unknown** = conservative tight ass , and opensource advocacy = good with people . it 's the perfect fit for a moderator .
i would simply like to say that you have created one kick-ass linux distro .

fucking crappy kernel mess !!! arg !!! why won't it just work !??
suffice to say , things that work in 3 . x break in 4.1 . and things that work in 4.1 break in 4.2 . the reason for this breakage is that transgaming burned their bridges and treated the community like shit . as their tree ages and bugs **unknown** , it 's only going to get worse .
ati drivers are pure shit .
nvidia drivers are a pain in the ass , but they work most of the time .
uh , i think you mistake the meaning of " pure shit " in this context .
most of the oems have awesome servers , because thats what they do , making desktops is just thier half ass on the side job :p

why would ubuntu fuck up ?
now does aptitude only track that shit for apps that it installed , or does it track all installed packages ?
especially if you know your shit
basically , i'm fucked .
bugzilla is a bitch to administer , i use roundup which is much easier to

this is retarded .
fuck ya man good job
i hate those damned " agents "
this is linux . if it 's not in the repo then she 's shit out of luck . better tell her to reinstall windows
i wouldn't define that as ' in trouble ' i'd define that as ' a good time to scrap that windows shit alltogether '
well , windows has always been bitching with networks . a total mess :/

shit , can't you do that !? fuck ! i didn't even know that . what about flash ?
id say ... nobody supports linux for shit because it holds next to nothing in the desktop market ( compared to m$)

i solved that by buying a playstation 2 , much nicer anyway to play on a big ass tv and with a proper controller :)

skype is shit
and are you running dnsmasq or isc-dhcp-server on the system you're running as an ap ? it 's kindof necessary if you want it to assing ip addresses .
no , it 's a portmanteau of **unknown** . you flatter the interface enough until it self-assings the right address ...
anyways , about my first question , can ubuntu be installed from the hardrive , or do i need to make a boot disk ? win7 is being retarded and doesn't seem to know how to make a boot disk
schnuffle , i saw torque but that looks like a giant pain in the ass , plus i only have one server , not a network of separate machines . i was hoping there would be some simpler solution that would be useful on a single smp server .
with truecrypt , you can make a rescue . iso file that will boot your encrypted filesystem if your loader gets fucked
true but shit happens
shit .
unless one of those have been compromised i'm certain only i have access to this server ( unless i've got a fucking keylogger on something on my laptop )
amsn is shit
it is fuckin typed correctly , i copy pasted it :d
looks like the program is shit .
no one seems to give a shit ( gonna kick me off the channel for saying " shit "? gonna do that to me too ? )

then why ubuntu comes with unity ass default ?
how in the nine hells do i get my damned usb soundcard working , pulseaudio is a damned pest :(
oh shit nigga
cause a+rwx doesnt do shit
anyway , i've checked all of the retard stuff like file permissions and disk space
i've concluded that it 's not me being retarded
please take the ranting to #ubuntu-offtopic and avoid called things " retarded " entirely . this is a support channel , not a place to just say that things don't work the way you like .
the question is why pulseaudio , a clearly retarded piece of software , is even distributed before it works to users ?
yes , because you gonna have to move your ass and make some tests .
some people ... " hey , this free software i got for free doesn't work the way i want , let me bitch about my entitlement problems instead of being constructive , filing bug reports , or trying to fix it "
which is completely retarded .
there is just no excuse for such retarded designs .
i don't give a shit about windows , but the friend i'm trying to install ubuntu for , wants to have the recovery partition for the time the windows needs a repair or fresh install
and is that a reason to commit retarded decisions ? hmm .. thanks for info , gonna to suggest to customer that they should get rid of ubuntu on their server
so you're saying i don't even need preseed shit , i can use kickstart format for ubuntu ?

i can`t play any music or video .... shit , i have no plan yet
histo : i've nailed it ! thanks to your guidance . it was a setting in my ~/ . **unknown** . in my vnc sessions it would'nt load my ~/ . **unknown** environment , so i asses it to my xstartup
i know know - i know i'm an ass , & tghere are plenty of gnu's, penguins & trolls abound :p

as in , i have a zlib1g package from a ppa called izx-bleeding-precise and if i try to ( within synaptic ) force that package back to the official ubuntu precise version , it seriously suggests removing **xorg** what kind of .. bleeping retarded suggestion is that ?
really ? if so they might as well chuck the whole ppa thing out the window . it 's immensely retarded to market a feature that 's so thoroughly b0rked as this . i can understand other issues , sure . but not being able to realize that the packages that these things are built against are available .. that 's just plain retarded .
