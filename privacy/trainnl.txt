my favourite thing about ubuntu so far is how little i had to customise my system to get it to work just like i wanted , only took me about 15 minutes to get everything just as i wanted 	 same here , 15 minutes and i was printing excel and word docs from emails to the office printer . windows couldn't even do that cause it took me hours to find the printer drivers online . ubuntu came with them 
and then what happens if the user wants to use a driver for a point kernel release where there is no module available in the distro 	 my only concern is when a user needs to support a device in which the distro has not detected and installed the driver - that is when the user gets stuck in kernel compiling land - a place where no user should be :p
